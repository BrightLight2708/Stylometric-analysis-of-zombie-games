[Flashback: nighttime in Farewell, Oregon. Chaos ensues everywhere. Near an
 alleyway, main character Deacon, his wife Sarah, and his riding buddy Boozer
 are contemplating escape.]

PA: Get to the nearest rooftop and stay there. Help will come. This is the
    National Emergency Response Organization. Repeat — All evacuees get off
    the streets. Remain indoors.

Deacon: Uh, she's burnin' up, the, uh, knife must have — nicked her kidney or
        somethin'. She's turning septic.

Boozer: How you doin'¹ little sister.

Sarah: So stupid. It was this little — this little kid, this — this Goddamn
       little kid.

Boozer: With a big Goddamn knife.
Deacon: Hey, help me. C'mon.

[They try lifting the wounded up Sarah up.]

Boozer: Ah, c'mon. Hey —
Sarah: Shit —

[They stop and listen for yelling nearby.]

Boozer: Another mob. We don't wanna be here when they come through.
Deacon: We gotta get to the roof. Flag down one of those choppers.
Boozer: Alright.

[Later, on a rooftop. A chopper is waiting there.]

Deacon: Wait, we need help — she's been wounded.
O'Brian: Wh — wh — what's wrong with her?

Deacon: Well she's not — whatever the hell's going on out there. She's been
        stabbed.

O'Brian: I can't take anymore.

[Deacon looks at his nametag.]

Deacon: Okay, listen. O'Brian? If we don't get her to a hospital, she's going
        to die.

O'Brian: There are no more hospitals.

Deacon: Oh c'mon, no more hospitals? You got, uh, doctors, you got triage, you
        got a MASH unit?

O'Brian: Uh, look I'm just a grad student, okay? I — I got volunteered for
         this, I'm not even supposed to be out here —

[Deacon waves a pistol in his face.]

Deacon: O'Brian.

O'Brian: Okay. Shit. I've only got room for two of you, okay? Two.

Deacon: What do you mean you've only got room for two of us, what do —

O'Brian: We're overweight, okay? I can only take two of you. Two.

Deacon: Okay. C'mon. Help me. C'mon. Alright¹ sweetheart. It's okay. You're
        gonna be alright.

[They lift her into the chopper.]

O'Brian: I got her.

Deacon: Hey, I'm gonna be right back.

[He walks over to Boozer, who's leaning near the rooftop door.]

Deacon: Okay, Boozer, let's go. We gotta get on that —

Boozer: Hold on. Hold on.

Deacon: We gotta get on that chopper.

Boozer: I heard what he said. There's only room for two on that chopper. Go.
        Go with her. I'll be okay.

[Deacon sees Boozer's lag is gashed open.]

Boozer: Look, I've been through worse shit than this before, yeah?

Deacon: Yeah, we have.

[He walks back to the heli.]

Deacon: Where are you going?
O'Brian: What?
Deacon: Where? Where?
O'Brian: Refugee camp, west of Three Fingered Jack.
Sarah: No.
Deacon: Boozer is never gonna make it without me.

[He takes off his Mongrels ring and slides it onto her finger.]

Deacon: I want this back.
O'Brian: You coming?
Sarah: No.

[The chopper lifts off.]

Boozer: Deek! Oh, shit. What did you do?

[Flashback ends. Scene: two years later, Boozer and Deacon are riding down a
 highway on O'Leary Mountain. They stop at the Old Pioneer Cemetery.]

Deacon: We lost 'im.
Boozer: He can't be far.
Deacon: Wait, hold on. Cut your engine.

[Nearby, an mortally injured woman is slumped near a monument.]

Boozer: Shit, she's alive. Alvarez. Alvarez, hey. Alvarez, what happened here?
        I mean, who did this? Was it — was it Rippers?

Alvarez: Leon — did this.

[Alvarez succumbs to her wounds.]

Deacon: Fucking Leon.

[Leon rides by on his bike.]

Boozer: C'mon.

[The two friends start their pursuit. Leon fires blindly behind him.]

Deacon: Oh shit!
Boozer: He's got ammo!
Deacon: No shit — he can't have much —

[Even as Leon slings molotovs, they're still hot on his heels.]

Boozer: You like that? Yeah? You sonofabitch!
Deacon: You hit him —
Boozer: Yeah, I think so — Whoa, whoa! Hold up, hold up! He laid his bike down.

[As they stop riding, they hit the deck when shots ring from the forest.]

Deacon: Cover me.
Boozer: Right behind ya.
Deacon: He went that way.
Boozer: C'mon.

[Boozer and Deacon head into the forest, following Leon's tracks.]

Deacon: Where the hell's he goin'? There isn't shit out here but a buncha
        Freaks —

Boozer: Well maybe I was wrong — about him — havin' a deal with Copeland —

Deacon: No — Leon's been fencing shit to Copeland for a long time — finally
        caught up with him.

Boozer: Hey, hey — wait, wait, hold up. Hold up.

Deacon: Shit — alright — lemme see —

[He scours the tracks in the dirt.]

Deacon: Wait, wait, wait — here. Down this way — Tracks are fresh. So where
        the hell'd you learn to track shit anyway —

Boozer: Used to go elk huntin' with my old man when I was a kid — ended up
        tracking shit for miles — 

[They reach a small wilderness campground. Leon's bullet grazes Deacon.]

Boozer: Holy shit — get down!

[Leon realizes he's run out of ammo.]

Leon: Fuck.
Boozer: C'mon.

[They follow on foot.]

Boozer: You okay, brother?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a graze. Sonofabitch can't aim worth a damn.
Boozer: Sonofabitch — 
Deacon: I'm fine, Boozer —

[The path bends near a small waterfall.]

Deacon: He must be heading down there, toward the falls.
Boozer: He's losing a lot of blood — he's not getting far. Come on.

[They find Leon nearby, bleeding from Boozer's shotgun blast earlier.]

Deacon: Search him. Bleeding out. That's a helluva way to go. It's slow. Lotta
        pain. But I suppose you'd know all about that, right¹ Leon?

Boozer: She was breathin' when we found her, you piece of shit.

Leon: I wasn't going to waste a bullet, not on her.

Deacon: Hold on a second, hold on a second. Now, where's the stash, Leon.¹ If
        you tell us, well, unlike you, I can promise you we'll make it quick.

[A Freaker's cry rings in the distance.]

Deacon: Doesn't look like you'd be suffering for too long. Leon, you got a
        little problem here, see — They can smell your blood, from all the way
        down there. What do you suppose that feels like, huh? Torn apart, eaten
        alive?

Boozer: Guess he's gonna find out.
Leon: Fuck you.
Deacon: Goodbye Leon.
Leon: No. Wait. Alright, alright, don't, don't — I got it right here, take it.

[He hands Deacon a piece of paper.]

Deacon: Where?
Leon: In the cemetery. It's in the old cemetery.
Deacon: Thank you.
Leon: No, you said —

[Deacon whirls around with his gun pointed at Leon's head.]

Leon: Do it. Don't leave me out here, man. Do it. Do it! Ya goddamned liar.
      Do it.

[He pulls the trigger. Boozer picks up his camo baseball cap.]

Boozer: Tuck's gonna need somethin' for the bounty.

[They start heading back to the road.]

Boozer: You did the right thing¹ bro — we don't want to leave anyone to the
        Freaks — not even a piece of shit like Leon —

Deacon: Hey, hold up — I wanna search this camp, see if I can't find something
        to fix up this scratch.

[He finds ingredients 

Deacon: Now I just gotta — put 'em together — and — yes — There — yeah, that
        ought to do it — Guess I — won't be losin' the arm anytime soon —

[They continue onwards.]

Deacon: Thought we were going huntin' tonight. Take some bounties in to Tucker
        —

Boozer: Well not if it's pissing down rain.
Deacon: Nah¹ man — we need the camp credits — gotta stock up on supplies.
Boozer: Yeah, okay. I don't want to be out all night though.
Deacon: Jesus — I gotta get in shape —

[They reach their bikes again.]

Boozer: Gonna see if there's anything we can salvage on Leon's bike.
Deacon: No. Goddammit.
Boozer: What?
Deacon: Sonofabitch.

[A pool of gas is underneath Deacon's ride.]

Boozer: I'm guessing that's the fuel line, unless you just pissed yourself.
Deacon: It's the fuel pump. Leon, yeah, shot out my damn fuel pump. Can we get
        anything off Leon's bike?

Boozer: Nah, it's done. Look, let's just go back to O'Leary Mountain. We'll
        head out in the morning, find some parts, and come back and get your
        bike.

[Deacon looks up at an old billboard for Crazy Willie's.]

Deacon: No. I think I got a better idea. Why don't we just get it while we're
        out here?

Boozer: What?
Deacon: Well — Crazy Willie's isn't far from here. Let's just head over there.
Boozer: What're ya thinking?
Deacon: We were goin' out hunting tonight anyway. Crazy Willie's is as good a
        place as any.

Boozer: Yeah. Okay.

[Deacon hops on Boozer's ride and they set off.]

Boozer: Hey, what did Leon give you?

Deacon: Map of some kind? Once we get my bike back, let's head up to the
        cemetery — look around.

Boozer: Yeah. Okay. So tomorrow, we get the drugs, take 'em to Tucker, collect
        on Leon's bounty. Then I say we head north.

Deacon: And you think shit's any different up north?

Boozer: Don't matter. I think it'd do us good, get the hell away from here.
        Hold on, something's blocking the road.

Deacon: Careful. I — saw a setup like this couple days ago — a bunch of Rippers
        blocked the road with an old truck.

Boozer: C'mon, help me move it. Ready?
Deacon: Yeah.
Boozer: Push —

[Drifters attack, catching them unawares as they push the vehicle out of the
 way. They're quickly dispatched.]

Deacon: C'mon. We're almost there.

[They hit the open road again.]

Boozer: Huh — we're comin' up on the old NERO checkpoint.
Deacon: We're almost there.

[The duo stops at a vehicle-choked tunnel —— a prime ambush site.]

Boozer: Shit, how you wanna do this?

Deacon: Loan me your shotgun. I'll walk point. Looks like that checkpoint had
        'em backed up pretty good.

Boozer: Yeah, a lot of good it did 'em. Hell, I'd rather be buried back with
        the Goddamned pioneers.

Deacon: Yeah.

Boozer: Shit. Look at 'em all. Bunch of Goddamned dumbasses, the lot of 'em.
        What were they thinkin'.¹ "Hey, Mr. Fed, can we — sit here and wait
        'til a Goddamned horde comes through and just kills us all?"

Deacon: Bad way to go out, trapped in a shithole like this.

[They advance a ways, stopping near a smelly Freaker nest.]

Deacon: You smell that?
Boozer: Oh Jesus. There. C'mon, let's go.
Deacon: Wait, hold up. How many Molotovs you got left back there?
Boozer: Let's hit it on the way back. Leave it.
Deacon: Yeah. Leave it my ass.
Boozer: Sonofabitch, you're hopin' someone's home.

[Deacon throws a molotov into the nest, hearing an anguished cry within.]

Boozer: Sounds like you got your wish.

[After killing the Freakers, Deacon starts mashing one corpse's head in.]

Boozer: Deek? DEEK! Hey Deek, Deek, Deek, Deek. Bro, bro. I think it's dead.
        You're gonna break my shotgun.

Deacon: Yeah. Okay.
Boozer: Alright —

[Boozer gets back on the bike.]

Boozer: You're going up there again.
Deacon: What're you talking about?

Boozer: The Goddamned refugee camp. You only act like this when you're thinkin'
        about goin' up there.

Deacon: Act like what?
Boozer: It's not your fault that she's dead.
Deacon: Drop it.

Boozer: If you'd gotten on that chopper with Sarah, all that would've changed
        is you'd be dead too.

Deacon: Look, just drop it.

[Ahead, some Freakers show themselves and set off a car alarm.]

Deacon: Damn alarm. You're not getting your bike through there.

Boozer: Try that service tunnel — see if you can clear us a path from the other
        side.

Deacon: I got it. Just keep your headlight pointed that way —

[He enters the service tunnel and is soon startled by a Freaker.]

Deacon: Jesus!

[Deke clears the path but triggers another alarm.]

Deacon: Damn alarm.
Boozer: Jesus — Deek!?
Deacon: I didn't plan on this, Goddamnit!

[They slay the Freakers attracted to the location.]

Deacon: Another nest.
Boozer: Ugh, yeah — I smell it —
Deacon: How many Molotovs you got left?
Boozer: You just used the last one.
Deacon: You got any shit to make more?
Boozer: Yeah, yeah —
Deacon: This'll just take a sec —

[He gets some supplies from Boozer's saddlebag and torches another nest.]

Deacon: Ready?
Boozer: Shit — Here they come!

[They make it through the tunnel unscathed.]

Boozer: Hey, c'mon, get on.
Deacon: Yeah, okay. Gimme a sec.

[The pair blazes down the highway.]

Deacon: I've been thinking about what you said, about riding north.

Boozer: Just sayin' — you need to get away from here. Clear your head, you
        know?

Deacon: In the morning, let's turn in the bounties and we'll hit the road.

Boozer: Hell yeah, brother. Now you're talkin'.

[They reach Crazy Willie's and it's teeming with enemies.]

Boozer: You wanted a Freakshow.
Deacon: Shit.

Boozer: Place is crawlin'. Shit, we're gonna need more ammo. What're you
        thinkin'? And I already know it's a bad idea.

Deacon: You just — ride on through. You pull as many of 'em off as you can.
        And I just, I go in through the back, down that hill, find the garage.

Boozer: Shit.
Deacon: Alright, you just give me a few minutes to find the part that I need
        — You ride back, we ride the hell out. After I kill a few of the
        bastards.

Boozer: I swear to God, you got a death wish.
Deacon: Like I said, not tonight.

[Boozer rides off as loudly as possible.]

Boozer: C'mon, you stinkin' sonsofbitches! Come on! That's right! Here I am,
        motherfuckers! Ol' Bill's right here!

[After continuing through the motel area, Deacon nears the garage. Boozer
 radios in.]

Boozer: Deek, how's it goin'¹ brother? You ready?
Deacon: Not yet. Still gotta find a way into Willie's garage. Gotta be a fuel
        pump inside.

Boozer: Well hurry your ass up. I rode past one of those — uh — what the hell
        do you call 'em? The — the shit that Rippers put up —

Deacon: Sigils —
Boozer: Yeah — and it means they're up here somewhere —

[Deek nears the garage.]

Deacon: Shit. Boarded up. Gotta find another way in. Maybe there's a — way in
        through the roof.

[He climbs an old shed to ascend higher.]

Deacon: Yeah — that's what I thought —

[A hole in the roof leads towards the garage.]

Deacon: Gotta be a fuel pump in here somewhere.

[He strips the part off an old chopper.]

Deacon: Boozer, you there? I found the part. I'm heading out to the highway —
Boozer: Deek. Rippers. Rippers! No, no, no, no — ah! Ah, shit!
Deacon: Rippers? Boozer? Boozeman? Goddammit. Oh Goddammit Boozer — where are
        you —

[Deacon heads up the road.]

Deacon: I hear 'em —

[Nearby, two Ripper cultists are a knocked-down Boozer with a blowtorch.]

Ripper: These tats are dead symbols of a dead man. Dead symbols of the Lost.
Boozer: Get off me! You sonsofbitches!
Ripper: Biker man. You must be brought low, biker man. For you are Lost, and
        we are Found.

Ripper 2: Teach him the Path, brother, the Path.

[He burns Boozer's right arm repeatedly with the torch.]

Ripper: We will show you! Get low. Get low! Low!
Deacon: Rippers — sonofabitch — Hey! Over here! You sonsofbitches — Get off
        him! Ripper assholes! Come on!

[He guns the three Rippers down.]

Boozer: Those Goddamn sonsofbitches, I'm gonna kill them all. Every fucking
        one of 'em!

Deacon: Boozer. Boozer, come on —

[He sees how burned Boozer's forearm is.]

Deacon: Oh my god.
Boozer: Oh shit!
Deacon: Uh, let me help you up.
Boozer: No, I got this.
Deacon: No, no, no, you don't. C'mon. Get up.
Boozer: Fuckin' Rippers.
Deacon: We gotta go, pal.

Boozer: It was like they were waitin' for me or something. Fuck! I didn't see
        'em and then — then they were on me.

Deacon: Okay.
Boozer: My arm.
Deacon: Don't look at it.
Boozer: My Goddamn arm. No, I — God!
Deacon: I'm serious, don't look at it. Don't look at it. Get on the bike!
Boozer: Oh, shit! C'mon, go, go!

[They ride off just as a giant horde comes down the road.]

Boozer: Fuckin' Rippers!

[The bikers ride back to their base at O'Leary Mountain's forest watchtower.]

Boozer: Shit. Thought we'd never make it.
Deacon: Hey, uh — Why don't you wait out here, let me make sure it's all clear.
Boozer: Screw that. There's a bunk callin' my name.

[Deek helps Boozer upstairs.]

Deacon: Alright, pretty much like we left it.
Boozer: What? Not like there's much to steal. Just gonna — reintroduce myself.

[He collapses on a bunk.]

Boozer: Oh thank God.
Deacon: I'm gonna go out, find some shit for your arm and get my bike. You

Boozer: Yeah.
Deacon: Good.
Boozer: Yeah.

Deacon: I'll head over to that NERO checkpoint. They gotta have sterile
        bandages or painkillers.

Boozer: Oh, wait. Don't — don't leave my bike there.
Deacon: No. No, no, no, I'm gonna be, uh, going out on foot while it's still
        light out.

Boozer: Hey, I got some ammo if you need it. In the footlocker by the door.
Deacon: Thanks.
Boozer: And, hey. Don't take my shotgun.
Deacon: Uh, Boozer — Alright. Here you go.
Boozer: Thanks¹ brother. Just — feel kinda naked without it.

[Deacon walks downstairs.]

Boozer: Dammit — Boozer. Your arm's not gonna be fine. Sonofabitch. I gotta
        find something for his arm.

[Deacon exits the grounds through an automatic gate.]

Deacon: I'm not taking Boozer's bike — I gotta get to mine before it gets dark.

[Down the embankment, a shadowy figure runs off.]

Deacon: What the hell — Boozer — are you awake?
Boozer: Yeah Deek — what's up?
Deacon: I just saw someone sneakin' around the safe house —
Boozer: What the hell — what's he doin'?
Deacon: No idea. I'm gonna follow him — see if there's some more where he came
        from. Deacon out.

[Deacon stalks the man until he returns to his camp.]

Marauder: So what'd you find?
Marauder 2: It's just like I said — those Drifters we saw, ridin' on the same
            bike? They're holed up, just up the road.

Marauder: Yeah? No shit.
Marauder 2: Helluva set up¹ — some kinda lookout tower, got a fence and
            everything. Ours for the taking.

Marauder: Sounds pretty sweet — I say when it gets dark, we go in — kill the
          sonsofbitches and then make ourselves at home —

Marauder 2: Uh, you know they're gonna have guns —
Marauder: Looked like one of 'em was pretty gimped up — we can take 'em.
Deacon: Yeah? Fuck you guys.

[Deacon kills the entire six-man marauder camp.]

Deacon: That's the last of them — Musta followed us here — Sonsofbitches —
        Stay the hell off O'Leary Mountain. Boozer — I found their camp. Just
        a few Drifters looking to move in on our safe house.

Boozer: Like we were sayin' before — it's time to start thinkin' about headin'
        north —

Deacon: Let's get your arm fixed up — and then worry about hitting the road.
        I'm gonna be heading to my bike. Deacon out.

[Deek starts walking through the nighttime wilderness towards his camouflaged
 bike.]

Deacon: Ah, damn Freakers —

[If Deacon strays from the path too much:]

Deacon: Where the hell am I¹ — I gotta be getting close — Gotta get to my
        bike — getting closer —

[He runs through the stormy weather.]

Deacon: Oh, damn rain — If it's not the Freaks — it's the Goddamn rain — Why
        is it always raining —

[He nears the highway.]

Deacon: Gotta get close — come on¹ baby — where the fuck are you? This is it
        — this is where we left it —

[Nearby, he finds the branches he camouflaged his bike with strewn about.]

Deacon: My bike's gone. Fuck! Dammit, Copeland!

[He sees a forager nearby.]

Deacon: Hey, you're from Copeland's Camp! Where the hell is my bike!? Hey,
        stop! Wait! Goddamnit!

Survivor: I didn't take your bike, man — I swear —
Deacon: I'm not gonna kill ya — stop runnin' — Jesus Christ —
Survivor: You gotta ask Copeland — I don't know nothin' —
Deacon: Hey! I just want my bike —
Survivor: I didn't do nothin' —
Deacon: Oh, Goddamnit. Alright — now I'm gonna kill you —

[The survivor sprints like a marathon runner, never letting Deacon close.]

Deacon: Boozer, you there?
Boozer: Yeah Deek — you get your bike?
Deacon: Nope. Copeland's men got to it before I did — I'm heading to his camp —
        Deacon out.

[He chases the survivor all the way back to Copeland's town.]

Survivor: Open the gate — open up! It's me — Reynolds — open up —
Deacon: Open the gate.
Guard: St. John — is that you?
Deacon: Some sonofabitch stole my bike —
Guard: Don't know nothin' about that — you gotta go talk to Manny.
Deacon: Okay — yeah, that's where I'm headed —

[Deek walks over to Manny, the local bike mechanic.]

Deacon: Hey Manny.
Manny: Hey, I haven't seen you around lately. Or been too busy to notice. Nose
       down. Work hard, they feed you.

Deacon: Yeah, camper's life.
Manny: Yeah, camper's life. I read a book once — "Zen and the Art of Bike
       Repair" — you ever read it?

Deacon: Nah, I didn't have a lot of time for books back in the day.
Manny: Yeah, I ran a shop, in Farewell. Made all the grease monkeys read it.
       "Bein' a mechanic requires great peace a' mind," it said. Try workin'
       on an empty stomach. That'll focus your mind.

Deacon: Manny, I'm looking for a bike.
Manny: Oh yeah?

[Deacon walks over to a frame stripped of most its parts.]

Manny: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't want that one.
Deacon: Why not?
Manny: Well, it just came off the truck. I mean, some dumb sonofabitch left it
       out in the shit, rusted up good. Been rode hard too, the fool that rode
       it didn't know shit 'bout bikes.

Deacon: Is that right?

Manny: Yeah, that's right. Shot to hell, this one. I mean, we just parted it
       out. It didn't even have a fuel pump, we coulda used that.

Deacon: Oh man, fuel pump. Like this one?
Manny: O-okay.
Deacon: Like this one, Manny?
Manny: Okay, okay. See now, when I said "fool," what I meant was — The fools
       that brought that bike in, see, they didn't tie that shit down properly
       — So they left it like, rattlin' around back there and —

Copeland: Deek? Let's talk.
Deacon: Looks like you had some trouble.
Copeland: Got hit hard last night — Rippers again. Twice now they've been up
          here. Some say looking for you and Boozer.

Deacon: Out in the shit, folks say a lot of things.
Copeland: Folks 'round here take care of their own — but go enough days without
          food — well, you see how it is.

Deacon: Lake not holding out?
Copeland: We get a fair amount of trout. Lake's fed by snowmelt. No one left
          to stock it with fish, gonna run out sooner or later.

Deacon: Like everything else.
Copeland: Used to go hunting out here with the old man. We'd build deer blinds
          out here, put down salt licks below us, pick 'em off clean. Some
          winters, had so much venison, we couldn't eat it all.

Deacon: I didn't think that was legal — deer baitin' — back in the day.
Copeland: My old man had only one law — the United States Constitution. If he
          could only see us now. America — Land of the Free!

Deacon: We are that.
Copeland: Saw Leon the other day.
Deacon: Yeah?
Copeland: He was bringing me something.
Deacon: Is that right?
Copeland: Folks here in a lotta pain, Deek.
Deacon: Oh, Leon. Tuck said that he took off. No one's seen him.
Copeland: Tell you what. You find his stash, you bring it to me. To me, Deek.
          You do that, well, we'll see what we can do for you.

Deacon: The bike. That your men stole. That you men parted out.
Copeland: Salvage, Deek. Salvage.
Deacon: Alright. I'll try to keep that in mind.
Copeland: By the way, nice hat.
Deacon: What?
Copeland: No, this one.

[He picks up Leon's hat — the bounty — from where it hangs on his belt.]

Deacon: Oh no, don't you ever touch me —
Copeland: Now, hold on. Leon wore a hat like this, didn't he?
Deacon: Oh Cope, I swear to God —
Copeland: Don't — You wanna do business in my camp? You start doing some runs
          for me.

Deacon: Cope — shit. Okay. I'm here anyway. Whaddya got?
Copeland: Now that's more like it. A group of Drifters has been harassing my
          supply runs. They've moved into the radio tower west of O'Leary
          Mountain. Isn't that your backyard?

Deacon: No, it's not. But I'll take care of 'em.
Copeland: I thought you might.

[Deacon returns to the mechanic shed near the entrance.]

Manny: Yo, Deek, Deek! Hold up. I just want to say how sorry I am. I — I didn't
       know, I swear!

Deacon: Do you have any idea how much time I put into that bike? It was a
        Drifter bike, Manny!

Manny: I know, I know. I'll make it up to you, I swear. I put together a new
       one.

Deacon: You call this piece of shit a bike?
Manny: I know, it's not — Look, I'll keep an eye out. For — for more parts.
       I'll hook you up. I swear.

Deacon: Okay, what about my custom gas tank, Manny — y'know, the one that I got
        from my dead wife? You gonna keep an eye out for that one too?

Manny: Jesus, Deek. I'm sorry.
Deacon: Just get the fuck outta my way.

Deacon: Jesus — this isn't a Goddamn bike. Boozer, you there?
Boozer: Yeah, Deek.
Deacon: Uh — how you doin'? How's the arm?
Boozer: Uh — like I said, I'll be fine.

Deacon: Okay. Uh — I'm still gonna head to that NERO checkpoint, fine some, uh

Boozer: Yeah, sure — whatever. I'm gonna go out — make sure the mountain's

Copeland: St. John — this is Cope. When you get to the tower — my radio uplink

Deacon: So these men — you know 'em? 'Cause shutting down Radio Free Oregon
        seems kinda personal.

Copeland: Goddamn right it's personal. They used to be a part of my camp,¹
          seems they didn't like the rules against stealin', rapin', murderin'

Deacon: Well, maybe they're like me — just tired of listening to your paranoid

Deacon: This is it — the NERO checkpoint — I gotta find some shit for Boozer's
        arm —

[He looks in the back of the unit for the generator.]

Deacon: Nope — not back here — Generator — gotta be a generator here somewhere
        —

[He finds a generator nearby.]

Deacon: Bingo — here it is — Come on you sonofabitch — you better start —

[A nearby jerrycan helps out the situation.]

Deacon: Yes —

[Power restored, he searches inside the locked-up NERO unit.]

Deacon: Sterile bandages — sterile bandages — where the hell would they keep
        this shit? Yes — sterile bandages. Just what the doctor ordered. Now I
        just gotta get this back to Boozer — oh — hello — what — what's this?
        NERO tech — uh — some sort of, uh — injector of some kind? Huh — why
        the hell not —

[Deacon heads back toward O'Leary Mountain.]

Deacon: Boozer? You there? Boozer? Goddammit — answer me — He's not picking up
        — where the hell is he?

Copeland: One more thing — when they left, it appears they may have stolen some
          automatic rifles and a few shotguns. You watch yourself.

Deacon: Jesus Cope — thanks for the heads up.
Copeland: I do what I can — Cope out.
Deacon: "Do what you can" — sonofabitch.

[Deacon returns to the safehouse watchtower.]

Deacon: Hey Boozer, I, uh, found some shit for your arm.

[Boozer lays lifeless on his bed, slumped to one side.]

Deacon: Boozer? Oh shit. Boozer! Hey — hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit!

[Boozer suddenly bolts upright with his shotgun.]

Boozer: Shit, Deek.
Deacon: Holy —
Boozer: I coulda blown your Goddamn head off.
Deacon: Look, uh, let me — let me see that arm, huh?
Boozer: No. Nope. I got this.
Deacon: C'mon, lemme see that arm —

[Deacon leaves the bandages with Boozer and heads out to Cope's radio tower.
 He eavesdrops on a convo once there.]

Billy: Fuck that guy.
Joe: What the hell you talking about?
Billy: Cope's got at least a couple dozen peeps, guns up the ass and every
       Goddamn one of 'em would soon as shoot ya than look at ya. Fuck them
       and their truther bullshit. Feds did this, NERO did that. God, I'm so
       sick of his shit. At least we don't have to listen to that crap no more.

Joe: Shit. Wait, what did you do? You shot up his generator, killed his radio
     uplink, didn't you?

Billy: Goddamn right I did. Now none of us have to listen to that shit. Fucking
       "Radio Free Oregon" bullshit, now it's "Copeland Free Oregon."

Joe: Stupid asshole. Whaddya think, he's just gonna let that fly? Dumbshit.
Billy: Whaddya mean?
Joe: Bastard's probably got a price on our head already — and now he knows just
     where to look.

Billy: Shit, I didn't think that —
Joe: Well ya got somethin' right for once in your shitty life, you didn't
     think. You didn't think when ya got caught stealin' fish, or when you beat
     that man to death — 

Billy: You ate the Goddamn fish, same as us.
Joe: Jesus Billy, I didn't know you stole it, killin' a man.
Billy: Cope cut our rations. Ray and I, we weren't thinkin' straight, we were
       —

Joe: You were being a couple dumbasses. Now look at us. We had a good thing
     going there. Yeah, Cope's a stupid sonofabitch, but he ain't no murderer.

Billy: I'm sorry Joe.
Joe: Not yet you ain't. Cope sends someone out here, then you might be.
Billy: So we goin' back and killin' the sonofabitch, am I right?
Joe: Jesus Billy, shut the hell up.
Billy: Just askin' —

[Deacon proceeds to kill 'em all.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em. Jesus Cope — how many men have you pissed off?
        Alright — this has gotta be the generator, but it's been shot to hell.
        Okay — that should do it.

Deacon: It's nothing — you know, I just let this Drifter get the drop on me.

Copeland: Copy that. You may not see the value in it, St. John, but Radio Free
          Oregon is the only thing keepin' us from turnin' into savages.

Deacon: No, Cope. The only thing keeping us from turning into savages is about
        nine square meals. Try going hungry for three days — there's no such

          streets in boxes and tents because they couldn't afford the "American

          to have the Feds forget about 'em as soon as they were done with 'em.

          for Put Them Soldiers Down. Well, we're all homeless now. Living in
          the wilderness in the way of our forebearers. The Feds used to think
          we needed their welfare and handouts to survive, we showed 'em how
          wrong they were. What we need now is a strong will, determination
          and trust in each other. The Feds were never gonna give us that. And
          you? You want our trust? You gotta earn it. This is Mark Copeland

Boozer: A chopper? What're you talkin' about?
Deacon: A NERO chopper! It just buzzed right over me, acted like I wasn't even
        there.

Boozer: All this time and a Fed chopper shows up outta nowhere?
Deacon: I'm gonna chase 'em down and I'm uh — I'm gonna see what the hell

           assess conditions. Note to Dr. Anderson — your theory about the

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah, actually. I was one of the survivors at the White King
               Mine.

Lt. Booth: Jesus.
Cpl. Franklin: Saw one tear my buddy apart, like it was peeling a banana. These
               suits? Protect you from a lot of shit. But not them.

Lt. Booth: Holy shit, Corporal. Jesus, I'm — I'm sorry.
Cpl. Franklin: That mission was FUBAR from the start.
Lt. Booth: Which is why we — are not going inside there.
Cpl. Franklin: Think if I sealed up this cave, we'd, I don't know — knock down
               their population?

Lt. Booth: I don't know Corporal. Lotta caves out here. Come on. Let's get out
           of here.

Deacon: Seal the caves? Yeah right. Like anyone gives a damn —

[Deacon heads back to his bike.]

Lt. Booth: We're pulling out —
Lt. Simpson: Load up! Load up!
NERO Researcher: Move, move, move!
NERO Researcher: Go, go go! Let's go!

[The heli takes off and disappears into the distance.]

Deacon: Boozer — you there? Boozeman, come back.
Boozer: Deek, heya — I'm here —
Deacon: When we rode outta Farewell, the NERO guy, the soldier or whatever-
        -the-hell he was — who took Sarah —

Boozer: Wait, what — what are you —
Deacon: He had an ID badge — what was the name?
Boozer: Oh, God — O'Brian. You wouldn't shut up about it — all the way out to
        Three Fingered Jack —

Deacon: Okay — he's alive, Boozer — he's alive.
Boozer: What are you talkin' about? We were there, the whole camp was wiped
        out.

Deacon: No, I know that, but I heard — okay, look — I went into their LZ, and
        they —

Boozer: Wait, wait — you — you went into their LZ? What the —
Deacon: Just listen to me. I heard them over the radio — they were talkin'
        about a man named O'Brian —

Boozer: Deek — don't —
Deacon: I'm not — Boozer — I'm not. I'm just — Hey, uh — get some sleep. Deacon
        out.

[One of Copeland's truther broadcasts plays soon after.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. The start
          of this living hell that is now our life came as a surprise to no
          one who was listening to me when shit went down. And I — was one of
          the few. Most who spoke out against the Feds? Well, things didn't go
          so great for them. The cemeteries are filled with martyrs, those who
          sought to call out the bullshit and the lies when they saw it. I
          know, because they came after me. I started Radio Free Oregon in the
          last weeks before the Feds fell. Broadcast from an unmarked van,
          moving from town to town in the days 'fore the roads became choked
          with cars and the bridges destroyed. Trying, in vain, to stop the
          Freaks. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe
          the lies.

Deacon: No, Cope — the cemeteries are filled with Freakers, not martyrs. And
        ya had to keep moving, 'cause if anyone had found your unmarked van,
        they'd have blown it to hell — just so we wouldn't have to listen to
        your bullshit Radio Free Oregon.

[Another radio broadcast can be heard soon after.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Black
          helicopters have been spotted in the skies. You might've seen 'em,
          heard 'em, thought you were losing your mind. But you're not. They're
          real. And they're proof that I was right. We thought NERO died out
          here like the rest of 'em, caving under their own stupidity. But no,
          like I said, they been lying in wait all this time, 'til they can
          crawl up out of their holes and reclaim this world. But it ain't
          happenin', not on my watch. And don't go runnin' towards 'em,
          thinkin' they're gonna save your ass. Any man wearin' a uniform worth
          a damn, died more'n two years ago. These men, they'll shoot you on
          sight. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the
          lies.

Deacon: Jesus — Cope, they're not trying to reclaim shit. You don't have a damn
        clue what you're talking about. Except — yeah, yeah, they will shoot
        you on sight. Lucky guy.

[Cope radios in afterwards.]

Copeland: Deek, oh Goddammit. I'm sick and tired a' Drifters coming into my
          camp, killin' folk like we were out in the shit —

Deacon: What's going on, Cope?

Copeland: A man come in — drugged outta his mind. Shot the place up — then he
          just took off — Manny said his bike's got a red tank on it and he
          was wearin' some kind of motocross helmet, silver.

Deacon: Okay. If I go now, I might be able to catch up to him.

Copeland: I want him alive¹ Deek —

Deacon: Alive?

Copeland: Alive. You catch this man, then radio me. We'll fetch him and hang
          the bastard, right from that limb. It's time we start showin' these
          Drifter sonsofbitches that we have law and order in this camp. No
          offense meant to yourself.

Deacon: None taken. I'll find him. Hey Cope — this man I'm tracking down —
        who'd he kill?

Copeland: Why do you care? It's just another bounty job, isn't it?

Deacon: No look, I don't care, I just wanna know their names. Who, Cope?

Copeland: One of 'em was a man named Randall, been with the camp almost a year.
          I didn't know the other two. You want me to ask?

Deacon: No. I guess not.

Copeland: You find that sonofabitch, you radio me. Copeland out.

[Deacon looks at the biker's last known whereabouts: a pond near a blockade.]

Deacon: This is it — Okay, let's see — what's going on here. You're mine now.
        There he is —

[Deacon pursues the biker when he rides by and shoots at his enemy's ride.]

Moto Rider: Oh shit — the hell —
Deacon: Silver helmet. Red gas tank, that's him — So you thought you'd ride
        into Copeland's Camp — shoot the place up — that about right? Kill a 
        few folks, take some shit, and just ride out, like you were just —
        going shopping at the mall —

Moto Rider: Go to hell, Drifter — Copeland can suck on it — you hear me?

Moto Rider: Dammit. No — no, no, no, no! Not my bike — no, no!

[Deacon shoots his way through the bike until it flips and he captures Moto.]

Moto Rider: What — did you — do — you sonofa — bitch — hey — no — no — no, no,
            no, no — no —

Copeland: Yeah well, Copeland kinda frowns on that. Not a fan of it myself, if
          you wanna know the truth. Gives Drifters a bad name. And what if you
          had shot Manny, you know? Who'd fix my bike then? Stupid piece of
          shit.

Moto Rider: Screw you — you're one of Copeland's toadies — you little bitch —
            that's what you are — you little bitch!

Deacon: Cope, it's done. I got him. Write down these coordinates and send your
        men out here.

Copeland: Is he alive?

Deacon: Yeah, he's alive. But I won't promise ya how long he's gonna stay that
        way. Deacon out.

[Shortly after finishing the railroad ambush camp, Boozer radios in.]

Boozer: Hey Deek, you there? I was thinkin' about heading down to that logging
        camp — clear out those nests. I've been seeing more Freaks up here.

Deacon: Boozer — no — no, you're gonna get yourself killed. Uh — you gotta
        wait 'til you're whole, brother. Uh — I'm over here anyway, so — I'll
        take care of the nests — okay?

Boozer: Yeah, okay. Thanks Deek.

Deacon: Nah, Deek — wait 'til tonight. Be fewer Freaks inside those nests —
        Or — take 'em out while it's still light out — there'll be more of 'em,
        but they won't be as strong —

Deacon: Okay, this is it — yeah, oh — this camp is gonna be crawlin'. Uh —
        yeah, nah — nah, ya gotta leave the bike out here, Deek or — it'll
        pull all of 'em down on ya. Okay — oh, there's gotta be a nest in this
        shack — Alright — fire in the hole — Come on boys and girls — let's do
        this — 

[He burns one out.]

Deacon: Okay — one nest done. How many more ya got? More in here? Yup — How'd
        ya like that? Huh? C'mon ya sonsofbitches — come on —

[He burns another and turns towards the large building nearby.]

Deacon: Oh — warehouse — yeah, it looks like the kinda place you wanna call
        home — yeah? Goddammit — what, did you all shit yourselves at once?
       Jesus Christ — Oh, Goddamn Freaks — what the hell are ya doin' in here,
       huh?

[He burns a third nest.]

Deacon: Getting kinda cold out here — thought I'd help ya out — This place is
        a deathtrap —

[He burns a fourth nest.]

Deacon: That'll warm you up — Okay — gotta be careful — gotta be careful —

[He burns a fifth.]

Deacon: Come on fellas —

[He burns the sixth.]

Deacon: Is that the last of 'em? Finally — Boozer — it's done. I cleared those
        nests. Should be less Freaks on the mountain from now on.

Boozer: Hey Deek — how'd it go? Were there — were there a lot of 'em?

Deacon: Yeah — but I wanted to clear 'em while it was still light out — you
        know how the sunlight bothers 'em —

Boozer: Yeah — that's — that's probably the — way to do it. Alright anyway,
        well — thanks for — thanks for doin' that — Deek.

Deacon: Get some shut-eye, Boozer. Deacon out.

Deacon: Boozer, you there? I'm just callin' to check up on ya.
Boozer: Yeah Deek, I'm here.
Deacon: You hang in there¹ buddy. As soon as we get that arm patched up, we're
        ridin' north. Just like you said.

Boozer: I hope so. God, I miss the open road.
Deacon: You just work on gettin' better. I still got some work to do on the
        bike, and we gotta stock up on some gear. But once you're patched up?
        We're outta here. Deacon out.

[Deacon rides two kilometers to Salome's hot springs — Tucker's stronghold.
 If he does, he'll fight a few Rippers on the bridge leading in.]

Gate Guard: St. John! It's okay.
Deacon: Where's Tucker? Alkai?
Guard: Over at the dig site.
Deacon: Well, which one, Goddammit.¹
Guard: North one. Back there.
Deacon: Anyone touches this bike, or anything on it, I break your fingers.
Guard: Whatever¹ man. Jesus.

[Deacon strolls over to a dig site for irrigated crops.]

Alkai: I keep telling you, everywhere you look, it's all one giant lava field.
       Twenty-five feet solid rock. It'll take jackhammers to —

Tucker: I don't need a lecture, Goddammit. I get it.

Alkai: No you don't. But these people are hungry. Even if they had all their
       strength — it'll take 'em months to finish this job with picks and
       shovels.

Tucker: I don't give a shit! We're all hungry, Al, but this job's gotta get
        done whether it takes all Goddamn year. It's not like we got somewhere
        else to be, now do we?

Alkai: Wait. I'm not finished.

Tucker: Well make it quick, will ya¹ Al? I got things to do.

Alkai: Rippers. This morning. One of my men spotted a large group of them
       coming over the pass.

Tucker: And no one stopped them?

Alkai: How the fu— Tucker, you know we're already spread thin.

Tucker: Are — are they headed north? Al, are they headed towards us? Yes or no?

Alkai: I — I don't know. Maybe he knows.

Deacon: What the hell² are you up to now, huh? What's this about, huh?

Tucker: Dammit¹ Alkai, it's not his job to know. It's your Goddamn job to know.

Alkai: I can't be in two places at one time. You either want me here running
       your dig — Or you want me out there in the shit, chasing the Rippers.

Tucker: Go check the stores, see how much ammo we got left. I'll tell Wheeler
        to watch the dig.

Alkai: What're you lookin' at?

Deacon: Oh, I dunno, just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.

Tucker: Don't.

[Alkai walks off.]

Tucker: Did you track down Leon?

[He hands Leon's bloody baseball cap to her.]

Tucker: Good thing someone around here knows how to make things happen. Ride
        with me.

[He rides shotgun in her golf cart as they patrol the encampment.]

Tucker: How long's it been since you found someone, brought 'em in?

Deacon: The kind of people left out in the shit, aren't the kind of people you
        want me bringing in.

Tucker: We lost two more to the fever.

Deacon: It's not my problem.

Tucker: You want our food? I'm making it your problem.

Deacon: I told you. We'll do runs for you, but we're not joining your Goddamned
        camp.

Tucker: Remind me again — my old woman's memory — why is that?

Deacon: Because it's a waste of time, Tuck.

Tucker: Well aren't you the optimist. Where's Boozer?

Deacon: He said he was gonna — head over to Copeland's Camp. See about —
        tradin' for some fish.

Tucker: You're not in bed with Cope now, are you? His camp near yours?

Deacon: It's not closer, or further. Look, I'm not Boozer's old lady. He goes
        where he wants.

[They drive past a large trash fire.]

Deacon: Jesus, you keep this shit burning all day and night?

Tucker: Got a lot of Freak corpses piling up out here, with men like you,
        doing your jobs. Damn right we keep it burning.

Deacon: Try using more gasoline. Burns faster. Less fumes.

Tucker: Like we got so much to spare? When it's all gone, what're you gonna put
        in that bike of yours? Spit 'n' sweat? Now what the hell is going on
        here?

Phillips: The count's off. Storage is missing food, and some ammo.

Tucker: Jesus. Who was on watch last night?

Phillips: Wheeler.

Tucker: Tonight, double the watch. This shit's starting to piss me off.

Phillips: You got it.

Deacon: Trouble in paradise?

Tucker: It's like I was sayin' — camp's like a prison. Buncha Goddamned lazy,
        liars, thieves, rapists, and murderers. You know why that is?

Deacon: No idea.

Tucker: 'Cause that's who we are. The Freakshow. Only folks survived were those
        mean enough, nasty enough, to out-freak the Freaks. The rest are here,
        hopin' I feed 'em, protect 'em, keep 'em nice and cozy an' warm so they
        can sit on their asses and watch the world end. You — get your ass back
        to work. Don't make me go get Cyrus. Lazy sonsofbitches — can screw
        around all they like on their time. Daytime, is my time. Runnin' this
        camp's no different than runnin' a prison.

Deacon: I can't remember what you said — you were — you were what, a warden or
        somethin'?

Tucker: Nothing so high and mighty. I was matron of the women's ward. You look
        like the sort who mighta spend some time in the pen — back in the day.
        You ever do time?

Deacon: I had my share of trouble, but never landed in K-state.

Tucker: I got a job for you. Larsen was on a run yesterday — passed through
        Marion Forks¹ said he saw someone. Young woman, looked like, but he
        only caught a glance. He stopped to look around, but he never found
        her.

Deacon: Is he sure?

Tucker: Larsen's been doin' this long as you. He knows a person from a Freak.
        But you got a knack for this. You head over and find her before the
        Freaks do.

Deacon: I'll see what I can do. But, look — Tuck, I want the rest of my
        credits — for Leon.

Tucker: You bring me warm bodies, I'll give you all the credits you can spend.
        I gotta go find Wheeler. Someone's lookin' at a night in the shack.

[Deacon walks over to Alkai's merchant stall.]

Deacon: Alkai.
Alkai: What do you want, Drifter?
Deacon: What's your problem? Hm?

Alkai: One of my men escaped a Ripper camp, over by Iron Butte. Got tortured,
       like they always do. But this time they kept asking him if he knew
       about two bikers, two men — Asking if he'd ever seen of 'em and heard
       of 'em.

Deacon: Lotta bikes around here. What's it — what's it got to do with me?

Alkai: The Ripper called 'em "Mongrels". How many Drifters still flying colors
       around here, as if that shit matters.¹ You ask me? You got a price on
       your head. How's it feel to be on the other side?

Deacon: Al, why don't you just show me what you got because I don't have time
        for your bullshit.

Alkai: Whatever you say, Deek.

[Back at his bike, he stares at the drug-filled cooler.]

Deacon: Now I just gotta figure out who I'm gonna give this to.

[If Deek chooses to give Leon's stash to Tucker:]

Deacon: We can't head north until I get better gear. Tucker it is. Hey Tuck.
Tucker: You got my drugs, from Leon?

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah, Cope wanted me to sell to him, but uh, I know who my
        friends are.

Tucker: You got that right. Go see Alkai. I heard Larsen brought in a stash of
        shotguns and rifles. Maybe he's got something you can use.

[If Deacon doesn't pick Tucker:]

Deacon: We can't head north until we get this bike fixed up. Copeland it is.

Boozer: I couldn't sleep. You — you remember what I said — back in the tunnel.
        Don't go up there, Deek. It's — it's makin' you crazy.

Deacon: Boozer, I — okay, look — I go up there, because there's Freaks up

Sarah: There you go. C'mon —

[The "kid" stabs Sarah. The hoodie hides her mutated face -- a Newt's face.]

Sarah: She stabbed me.
Deacon: Oh hell. Oh hell. Uh, how bad is it?
Sarah: Um, I don't know, I don't — I don't think it's that bad.
Deacon: Jesus. Okay, look, just hold this here, as tight as you can.
Sarah: Okay.
Deacon: Can you run?
Sarah: I don't think so, but I think I can walk.
Deacon: Okay, good enough. We're almost there.
Sarah: Okay.

[Later, on a deserted street...]

Deacon: Two hours ago this place was crawling with Feds.
Sarah: Yeah, they must have — evacuated.
Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They must have bugged the hell out.

[Later, after reuniting with Boozer.]

Deacon: Uh, she's burnin' up, the, uh, knife must have — nicked her kidney or
        somethin'. She's turning septic.

Boozer: How you doin'¹ little sister.

Sarah: So stupid. It was this little — this little kid, this — this Goddamn
       little kid.

Boozer: With a big Goddamn knife.
Deacon: Hey, help me. C'mon.
Boozer: Ah, c'mon. Hey —
Sarah: Shit —
Boozer: Another mob. We don't wanna be here when they come through.
Deacon: We gotta get to the roof. Flag down one of those choppers.
Boozer: Alright.

[They take shelter in a warehouse.]

Boozer: Here, see if you can rest over here.
Deacon: Hey. Easy, easy.

Sarah: She reminded me so much of my little sister, you know? We used to play
       that hide-and-seek game all the time. And she would just — She used to
       hide — hide her head in her coat, just like that.

Boozer: I been cut in my day, but nothin' like that.
Deacon: She's burnin' up.

[A mob races by, casting shadows all over.]

Boozer: Jesus. Look at 'em.
Deacon: We gotta move.
Boozer: We ain't goin' that way.
Deacon: Okay, uh — c'mon.
Boozer: Alright.
Deacon: Hey, sweetheart, can you move?
Sarah: Okay.
Deacon: Boozer —
Boozer: Yeah, I got her. Go find us a way out.

[Further in the warehouse, a man is shooting in a rage. The trio takes cover.]

Scared Man: Just get out!
Deacon: Shit.
Scared Man: Just get out! You killed her, you killed —
Deacon: Hey, okay, okay. Everyone, hold up, hold up.
Boozer: Okay, here we go. Easy, easy —

[Deacon peeks from behind cover and gets shot at.]

Boozer: What're ya thinkin'?
Deacon: Uh — Okay. You get his attention. I'm gonna try to sneak behind him.
Boozer: Okay.

[Boozer winces from his wounded leg.]

Boozer: It's nothin'. It's nothin'. Go, go. I got this, go!

[The plan works and Deacon manages to get behind the shooter.]

Scared Man: Fuck you!
Deacon: Sir? Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed!
Scared Man: Get out!

Deacon: Now listen to me, listen to me — My girl's out there, she's been
        stabbed, we're just tryin' to get to the roof — Where there is a
        helicopter waiting.

Scared Man: Get outta here! You killed her!
Deacon: So listen, we just —
Scared Man: You killed my wife! You did it. You did it.

Deacon: Oh no, no. Now look, I — I don't know anything about your wife being
        killed.

Scared Man: Get outta here! You killed my wife! Get outta here! Get outta here!
Deacon: I — I am sorry¹ sir, now listen¹ we didn't do anything —
Scared Man: You did it. You did it.
Deacon: We didn't do it, okay! Listen, just, just, give me the gun!
Deacon: Give me the gun! Oh, God.
Scared Man: You killed — my wife! You killed her! You killed her!
Deacon: Just stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop!

[Deacon has no choice but to fire on the guy, killing him.]

Deacon: Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh Jesus.

Sarah: Deek, what happened to you? What's wrong?
Deacon: Let's go.

[Later, on a rooftop. A chopper is waiting there.]

Deacon: Wait, we need help — she's been wounded.
O'Brian: Wh — wh — what's wrong with her?

Deacon: Well she's not — whatever the hell's going on out there. She's been
        stabbed.

O'Brian: I can't take anymore.

[Deacon looks at his nametag.]

Deacon: Okay, listen. O'Brian? If we don't get her to a hospital, she's going
        to die.

O'Brian: There are no more hospitals.

Deacon: Oh c'mon, no more hospitals? You got, uh, doctors, you got triage, you
        got a MASH unit?

O'Brian: Uh, look I'm just a grad student, okay? I — I got volunteered for
         this, I'm not even supposed to be out here —

[Deacon waves a pistol in his face.]

Deacon: O'Brian.
O'Brian: Okay. Shit. I've only got room for two of you, okay? Two.
Deacon: What do you mean you've only got room for two of us, what do —
O'Brian: We're overweight, okay? I can only take two of you. Two.
Deacon: Okay. C'mon. Help me. C'mon. Alright¹ sweetheart. It's okay. You're
        gonna be alright.

[They lift her into the chopper.]

O'Brian: I got her.
Deacon: Hey, I'm gonna be right back.

[He walks over to Boozer, who's leaning near the rooftop door.]

Deacon: Okay, Boozer, let's go. We gotta get on that —
Boozer: Hold on. Hold on.
Deacon: We gotta get on that chopper.

Boozer: I heard what he said. There's only room for two on that chopper. Go.
        Go with her. I'll be okay.

[Deacon sees Boozer's lag is gashed open.]

Boozer: Look, I've been through worse shit than this before, yeah?

Deacon: Yeah, we have.

[He walks back to the heli.]

Deacon: Where are you going?
O'Brian: What?
Deacon: Where? Where?
O'Brian: Refugee camp, west of Three Fingered Jack.
Sarah: No.
Deacon: Boozer is never gonna make it without me.

[He takes off his Mongrels ring and slides it onto her finger.]

Deacon: I want this back.
O'Brian: You coming?
Sarah: No.

[The chopper lifts off.]

Boozer: Deek! Oh, shit. What did you do?

[The flashback ends. Deacon's still at the NERO camp memorial site.]

Deacon: You uh — you rest easy, okay? I'll, uh — I'll be back to check on you,
        and — I know — yeah, you wouldn't want me to, but — I guess Boozer's
        right — I can't — I can't help myself. It's, uh — it's like I said —
        I'll be back.

[After reminiscing at the gravesite, a heli flies overhead and disappears.]

Deacon: Boozer? Another NERO chopper — wonder what the hell they're up to —

[As Deek heads for Marion Forks, he listens to another truther broadcast.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Today I was
          thinking about where it all began. The roots go deep, back to the
          big dub-ya dub-ya two. 1947, the Feds passed — what they call it?
          "The National Security Act." Now — what this did — was give the Feds
          the right to take over our roads, railroads, and radio — anything
          they damn well pleased — without a warrant. Today — the Feds are
          gone, but we're still here — shining the spotlight a' truth on the
          world. Truth is — I seen it coming. Years ago, we had photos — NERO
          death camps, built to hold us — American citizens. No one believed
          me. If more of us had spoken up, none of this woulda happened. Tell
          you one thing — it won't happen again. This is Mark Copeland for
          Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Well, you're right about one thing, Cope — all these NERO refugee
        camps? They did turn out to be death camps — just not the way you were
        expecting.

[Around nighttime, near Marion Forks, another NERO chopper is spotted.]

Deacon: What the hell? Jesus.
Boozer: You went up there again, didn't you — after I told you not to.

Deacon: Look — would you just leave it, alright? I'm just out hunting Freaks
        — Boozer, you got that? Bounties — that is the only reason I go up
        there.

[Deacon continues pursuing the helicopter. Mutated wolves appear nearby.]

Deacon: Shit — runners — dammit.

[He shoots the wolves and continues until the heli hovers over a crossroads.]

Deacon: Whoa, whoa, whoa — hold on, hold on — they're slowing down — looks like
        they're stopping —

[When he approaches, they open fire, causing him to crash.]

Deacon: Motherfucker —
Boozer: Deek? Deek, what's going on?
Deacon: Sonofabitch —
Boozer: What happened? You okay?

Deacon: No no no I'm fine — I'm fine, I think they were just uh — warning
        shots — I mean, if they were trying to hit me, I would be dead —

Boozer: Deek — Remember me telling you about that death wish of yours?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got this. Deacon out.

[From a hilltop, Deacon spies on the copter crew. They have a semi-sedate Newt
 with a device around its neck, like what animal control personnel would use
 to corral large pests.]

Cpl. Franklin: Tranq isn't working.

Lt. Booth: Oh, it's working, or this little shit would've torn your head off
           by now.

Cpl. Franklin: C'mon Doc, hurry it up!
Lt. Booth: Sonofabitch, calm the hell down.
Cpl. Franklin: Incoming!
Lt. Booth: Gimme a minute!

[He executes the wrangled Newt as a large horde starts to swarm.]

Lt. Booth: What are you doing?
Cpl. Franklin: Pack it up, we're out! Shit, let's go — go! Hell.
Lt. Booth: Abort mission — abort!
Cpl. Franklin: Go, go, go! Shit! Goddammit, let's go!
Lt. Booth: Load up! Load up! Go!

Deacon: Oh Jesus — is that a Horde?

[The horde follows the heli into the distance. A green light flickers nearby.]

Deacon: Hello — what did you assholes leave behind? Yeah, okay — it's a radio
        alright.

[As he goes to pick it up, a Newt pushes him down and snatches it.]

Deacon: Hey — Goddammit! Get back here with that! You little shit — that's
        mine!

[He guns it down.]

Deacon: Oh finally — Jesus Christ, those shits can run fast.
Boozer: So, what the hell are they doin'?

Deacon: It looks like they were out here — shit, wrangling Freaks — I don't
        know. They had a Newt in some kinda noose, like they were putting a
        tracking device on it or somethin'.

Boozer: What? Wrangling? Whaddya mean?

Deacon: You know, like tying it up, taking samples from it or something — like
        those guys used to do on that wildlife show. Pretty fucked up. They got
        chased off by Swarmers. Bugged the hell out. And they left some gear
        behind. A radio.

Boozer: Wait — you don't — you don't think that — Sarah —

Deacon: No — no — not — I — I — I — I don't know. I'm just — and he's alive,
        Boozer, he's alive. O'Brian — one of them, NERO — I'm gonna track him
        down, if I can. I — I'm gonna — I'm gonna get some answers.

Boozer: Dammit — okay. Look, I'll be able to ride soon — I'll help you, Deek.
        If he's alive, we'll find the bastard.

Deacon: You're Goddamn right. I'm gonna check in later. Deacon out. Okay,
        O'Brian — where the hell are you?

[Back at his bike, Deacon's mind drifts back to the first time he met Sarah,
 on a country road with her car broken down. He pulls up as she works under
 the hood.]

Sarah: Oh, God.
Deacon: Hey.
Sarah: Hey.
Deacon: So, I'm sorta lost. I was hopin' you could help me out?
Sarah: I'm sorry, you're lost?

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah, I'm looking for the Old Belknap Road, and there's not a
        lotta signs around here.

Sarah: Oh, c'mon, you gotta be kidding me.
Deacon: Nope.
Sarah: What? What is it? What —

[He turns his mirror to show she has an oil smudge on her face.]

Sarah: Oh, that's great.

[The car makes a deflated wheezing noise.]

Sarah: Oh, that's just perfect. That — that is great. That is great.
Deacon: So about those directions?

Sarah: What? I'm really sorry. I — I don't know where Belknock, Belnack, 
       Belknee, Bell —

Deacon: Belknap?

Sarah: Belknap, that's the one. And I don't know where it is. I really can't
       help you. I'm sorry.

Deacon: So, no, then?
Sarah: Nope.
Deacon: Okay. Well — thanks anyway.
Sarah: Hey!

[He rides off a little, but then stops, pretending to ignore her plight.]

Sarah: Alright.
Deacon: Could you use a ride?
Sarah: Yes I could, thank you for finally offering. I'm Sarah.
Deacon: I'm Deacon.

[They shake hands; she gets oil on his.]

Sarah: Oh, well, sorry about the mess. Uh, um — I don't know — how do I, uh
       — this contraption —

Deacon: Pretty much what you think, just throw you — leg over, yeah.
Sarah: I just — Okay. Ummm, just — on there — whoa — okay. Ready. Hey — hey!
Deacon: Hold on tight.
Sarah: Thank you so much.
Deacon: No problem.
Sarah: It's just — there are no bars out here, so —

Deacon: Well sure there is — there's — place called Crazy Willie's up the road
        — there's, uh —

Sarah: No, I meant cell phone reception —
Deacon: I knew what you meant —
Sarah: Right¹ of course — anyway —
Deacon: So what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?

Sarah: You know, I ask myself that all the time. I do research, um, you know,
       I study things.

Deacon: Thanks, I had no idea what research was —

Sarah: Sorry, um — I do plants.
Deacon: You study plants!
Sarah: Yeah —

[Ahead, some hicks' wildly driving truck nearly knocks 'em off the road.]

Sarah: Hey! Hey, look out! Oh my God.
Deacon: Shit! Hold on!
Redneck: Woo hoo!
Deacon: Assholes!
Sarah: Oh my God!
Deacon: Are you okay?
Sarah: Yeah, I'm just — Oh lordy that was close.
Deacon: Hey, you sure you're okay?
Sarah: Yeah I'm fine. I just — Oh my God.

[Her phone rings.]

Sarah: Hey. Hey. I've got cellphone reception. Hey. Yeah, I'm fine, I just —
       The car you gave me? It's a real piece of shit. I need a tow. I'm on,
       uh, um, some — I dunno where I am —

Deacon: Road 42.

Sarah: Road 42. Yeah, I'm — I'm about a mile up. Okay, I'll see you when you
       get here.

Deacon: C'mon, I'll take you back to your car. We can wait for the tow truck.
Sarah: I don't know.

Deacon: Well alright. I'm sure when those boys come back, they'd be happy to
        give you a ride, so —

Sarah: Okay, alright. Alright! I just — Just give me a second.
Deacon: They'll be any minute now, so —

Sarah: Alright, alright, alright! Screw it, let's go. Just drive a little
       careful this time, okay?

[They start driving back to her car.]

Sarah: You weren't really lost, were you?

Deacon: Well that all depends on who you ask. My ex would say I've been lost
        for years.

Sarah: Well you certainly know your way around here.
Deacon: So you're not from around here.

Sarah: No, I'm from Seattle. The company that I work for, they just — they
       opened this lab here. So, here I came, to the middle of nowhere.

Deacon: To research plants.

Sarah: That's right. I already told you, I forgot. Um, yeah so — the company
       that I work for, they — they do work for this bioengineering firm, and
       um, some of the plants that I — I look at are pretty rare — and they
       just happen to grow here.

Deacon: That — has gotta be the best thing I've ever heard.

[As they approach her car, they can see the hicks from before standing near.]

Deacon: Oh — what the hell —
Redneck: Clete! We got company.
Sarah: Oh shit.
Deacon: Alright, gentlemen.

[Deacon quickly loses the fistfight and they start wailing on him.]

Redneck: Who's smart now, huh? That's what I thought.
Redneck 2: So what do we have here? Big bad biker, huh?
Redneck: Yeah! Yes, hit him again!
Redneck 2: How do you like that, biker boy? Not so tough now, are you?
Redneck: Work of art, it's lovely, do it, come on, hit him! Hit him!
Redneck 2: You don't learn, do you, biker boy?
Redneck: I could watch this all day. Oh yes. Yes!
Redneck 2: I'll teach him. I'll teach him good,¹ yeah you like that? How 'bout
           that —
Redneck: C'mon —

[Sarah, who was digging in Deacon's bag, fires his pistol.]

Redneck: Shit! The hell?
Redneck 2: Oh screw this¹ man, I'm out!
Redneck 3: Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, hold up, hold up!
Redneck: Roll¹ Goddammit! Roll!

[They scramble to their truck and flee.]

Sarah: Oh Jesus. Oh my God. Oh no, no. Oh, oh my God.
Deacon: Uh. Hey.

Sarah: I'm so sorry, I — I don't even know. I was just looking in your bag and
       I — I saw that and I —

Deacon: No, no, no. No, it's alright. Oh —
Sarah: Oh my God, I could have killed somebody. Oh shit —
Deacon: Well, yeah, but you gotta kinda aim it at them first.
Sarah: I've never done anything like that before. I saw —
Deacon: Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay. They're gone. They're gone.

Sarah: I saw it in your bag and I just — I tried to call the police but there
       were —

Deacon: You did good. You know what we're gonna do — what we're gonna do?
Sarah: There were no bars. There was no reception.
Deacon: I'm gonna wait right here until your guy comes.
Sarah: Okay.
Deacon: Thank you.
Sarah: I've never done anything like that.
Deacon: Huh. Coulda fooled me.
Sarah: Yeah?

[The previous mission ended near Marion Forks, so Deacon radios in.]

Deacon: Tucker — Hot Springs Camp, you there? I'm gonna need more info on that
        survivor Larsen spotted — in Marion Forks.

Tucker: Deacon — I already told you everything I know. Young, a woman — wait —
        he mentioned Hungry Jim's — that old pancake house by the East Bridge —

Deacon: Lumberjack, big stack of pancakes — yeah, I know the one. Okay, I'll
        start there.

Tucker: You do that. And remember, bring her to me. A group of Drifters came
        through the other day, traded us a few guns. Maybe something you could
        use.

Deacon: I'll keep that in mind. Deacon out.
[Deacon arrives at the restaurant.]

Deacon: Alright, where are you hiding? You gotta be here somewhere. I would
        need water, maybe — maybe down by the creek. Gotta look around.

[He scours the leftover tracks at the water's edge.]

Deacon: Gotta be hers. This must be where she comes to get water. Yeah, you
        come here for water everyday, don't you? But you move cautiously — you
        don't stick around long. Good for you.

[Her trail leads into the pancake house.]

Deacon: Smart girl. Stay off the street. Only come out at night — the Freakers
        are out, but she'd be harder to see.

[Some thugs roll in on loud motorcycles.]

Deacon: Fucking Rippers — none of you are getting outta here alive.

Ripper: I tell ya, I saw her Goddammit. Spread out, look around. There's a
        girl here somewhere. Search those buildings! I want eyes on every part
        of this shithole. You guys got that? Alright then, move!

[With the Rippers dead, Deek moves near a house they were scouting.]

Deacon: House is sealed up — how's she get in and out? Ladder — this is it.
        Come on — Just gotta — set it — here. Alright¹ kid — where ya hiding?

[He finds a silent girl in a bedroom, cradling a stuffed animal.]

[He kills a large bear feeding near his bike.]

Deacon: C'mon, get on. We have to move.
Lisa: I don't know about this —
Deacon: C'mon, kid — we gotta go.
Lisa: Okay — Hey — what's your name?

Deacon: Uh, Deacon. My name's — Deacon. Uh, Lisa — Lisa, how did you live out
        here — alone — for all this time? You don't talk much, do you?

Lisa: My dad's a rock hound. He used to take me out here looking for thunder
      eggs.

Deacon: Thunder eggs? Uh — what is —
Lisa: They're rocks, but — when you cut them open they're really pretty inside.
Deacon: Okay — that sounds great —

Lisa: We used to go all over — Belknap Crater, the Lava Flow, and Black Crater
      — everywhere. Do you think he's at the camp too?

Deacon: Uh — I dunno, kid.

[As they ride back toward Salome, the tunnel they're in has flashlights ahead.]

Deacon: Shit, someone's in the tunnel —
Lisa: What?
Deacon: Here — hop off.
Lisa: What are we doing?

Deacon: Listen to me — the gunshots that you heard? Those were — really bad
        men. Do you understand?

Lisa: Yes.
Deacon: Stay here, find someplace to hide. Don't come out until I say so. Okay?
Lisa: Yeah, okay.
Deacon: Alright¹ you sonsofbitches, let's get this started.

[He slays the would-be ambushers.]

Deacon: Lisa? Kid? Come on out, it's safe — You okay?
Lisa: Yeah, yeah. I — I think I want to go home.
Deacon: Nah kid, the camp. You'll be safe there. You'll see.
Lisa: Okay.

Deacon: I'm gonna ask you a question, Lisa, and I need you to think real hard.
        Did any of your neighbors — did they own any firearms? You know, like
        pistols, rifles, things like that.

Lisa: No. Men came and took everything.

Deacon: Men? Were they like the men in the tunnel, or — or did they wear
        uniforms, like, uh — like in the army?

Lisa: Like the army. But they were really dirty and they carried flags they
      made themselves — um, Deschutes County Militia, I think. I don't
      remember.

Deacon: Did they have anyone with them? Women? Children?
Lisa: I don't remember —
Deacon: Okay —
Lisa: Tommy would remember.
Deacon: Tommy?

Lisa: Tommy Strickland. My best friend. But — he's gone. He left with his dad
      to hide.

Deacon: Hide? I don't —

Lisa: His dad built a fallout shelter and put all kinds of stuff in it. Maps,
      food, water, guns — y'know, stuff like that.

Deacon: Okay — okay, do you know where that is?

Lisa: No. They wanted me to come with them, but I knew my mom and dad would
      come back for me.

[They pull into the hot springs.]

Deacon: Alright — this it is, we're here. So just — stay with me.
Lisa: Okay.
Tucker: Well, who do we have here?
Lisa: Mrs. Tucker!
Tucker: Oh my God. Lisa, honey. It's okay. You're safe now.

Lisa: Mom and dad and everyone got sick, and I didn't know what to do and —
      Men came and people got sick and —

Tucker: Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. You're safe now. It's a miracle. It's a
        Goddamn miracle. We were neighbors, weren't we¹ Lisa? I lived just
        down the block. I knew her parents.

Lisa: Are they here, Mrs. Tucker?

Tucker: Honey, you know the answer to that.

Lisa: No, they're not here.

Tucker: Let's go in. Get you cleaned up. Something to eat. And then I'll find
        for you a place to sleep. Take her in. Give her some food.

[Lisa walks into Tucker's cabin.]

Tucker: Go see Alkai. I'll update your credits tonight.

Deacon: Hey, hey, listen, listen, she's — she's been through a lot, can we
        just —

Tucker: Let me worry about how I'm gonna —

Deacon: Take it easy on — No listen to me, okay, seriously, don't work her like
        you do everyone else.

Tucker: Don't tell me how to run my camp. You want to move here? You wanna help
        help us run this? Then maybe you get some say. Don't get soft on me,
        Deek.

[One sunny day, Deacon meets up with Copeland in the wilderness.]

Copeland: So, you wanna learn how to hunt, that what I'm hearin'?
Deacon: I know how to shoot a gun.
Copeland: It' s a rifle, not a gun.

Deacon: I was in the 10th Mountain, Cope. Don't give me any of your Marine
        Corp bullshit.

Copeland: Killin' a buck's a little different than killin' a man, or a Freak.
          Best way to hunt an animal is to track it. You gotta focus, and see
          what nature's tryin' to tell ya. If you look hard enough, you'll see
          the signs.

[Deacon starts following the buck's trail.]

Copeland: Well, okay then. Look hard. See this pile of deer scat? It's fresh.
Deacon: Yeah, I see it.
Copeland: They lead this way.
Deacon: Yeah, I can see that.
Copeland: Well, come on then. Quick — there's your buck.
Deacon: I see him.

Copeland: Now here, use my rifle. If you were in the 10th Mountain, you know
          how to use a scope.

Deacon: Yeah, Cope. I know how to use a scope.
Copeland: Easy — easy —
Deacon: I got this —

[Deacon fires. If he misses:]

Copeland: Thought you knew how to shoot a gun.
Deacon: I'm — outta practice.
Copeland: Hurry, try again.
Deacon: Well maybe if someone would shut the hell up.

[Either way, Deacon has to hit it to continue the mission.]

Copeland: You got him — nice shot —
Deacon: Oh, Goddammit — it wasn't a kill shot — he got away —

Copeland: No, no — that's okay. You wounded him. He'll bleed out soon enough.
          We just gotta track him.

Deacon: Okay —
Copeland: See the blood spots? Look close —
Deacon: Yeah, I see 'em —
Copeland: Then follow 'em —
Deacon: On it —

Copeland: He'll be slowin' down about now. Losin' too much blood. We should
          be coming across his carcass anytime now. Okay, you know how to gut
          an animal?

Deacon: Yeah, look — Cope, Boozer and I have been hunting before. He used to —
        go elk hunting — with his old man and, yeah — he, uh — showed me how
        to gut a deer.

Copeland: Well, let's just say, no disrespect to Boozer, but — you got a lot
          to learn. You're wasting a lot of meat there. Overall, not bad — for
          a beginner.

Deacon: Yeah, thanks.
Copeland: Now, I'll take back that rifle.
Deacon: Here, thanks.

Copeland: Like I said, Deek. We can always use more venison at the camp. Still
          got some folks tryin' to heal up from that Ripper attack.

Deacon: Okay, Cope. Yeah, I'll see if I can — remember that.

[A new broadcast plays later.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. I grew up
          in these here woods. My grandfather taught me all about huntin'.
          Funny how it still works in a world he never would've dreamed of. I
          built my first tree house to work as a deer blind. Gettin' height on
          your target helps your aim and keeps you safe. Back then, I took out
          my first doe from up top. Today, my camp's up in the trees. You wanna
          survive and can contribute, you come to me, we got you covered.
          Grandfather also taught me, to catch a doe, sometimes you gotta lay
          an ambush. Hide where they need to go — like a watering hole. Today,
          you're as likely to be prey as hunter, so you gotta keep your eyes
          peeled when you're hittin' up places we all need to go. But
          Grandfather always said the easiest way to a good meal was to lay a
          trap. Put a snare by a tree, and you could have dinner next time you
          come round. But careful. A headless snake can still bite, 'specially
          when it ain't really dead — my grandfather would've outlived us all,
          let me tell you. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't
          believe the lies.

Deacon: Oh that's great, Cope. So you and your grandaddy set traps for 'em,
        and you and your old man used to lay down salt licks — yeah¹ that's
        really sporting. I guess none of that shit matters now.

[After leaving Salome in Mission #21, the NERO radio transmits briefly.]

Cpl. Elliot: Report.

O'Brian: Yeah, this is O'Brian. I was just about to check in. We're heading
         over to the Metolius Springs site, doing some follow up on an earlier
         field report.

Deacon: O'Brian — it's Goddamn O'Brian. What did he say — Metolius Springs —
        Metolius Springs — yeah, yeah, I know where that is. Hey Boozer — you
        there?

Boozer: Yeah, Deek —

Deacon: I just caught a break. That NERO radio might actually be useful. I
        know where they're going tomorrow.

Boozer: Wait, I thought you said you couldn't take 'em on.

Deacon: No, I can't, but — with a little luck — I can get to their chopper
        without being seen and —

Boozer: Give 'em hell, brother — remember what Jack used to say — don't ride
        faster than your guardian angel can fly.

Deacon: Like I said, Jack used to say a lot of stupid shit. Deacon out.
        Alright, let's go see what the hell NERO is up to. O'Brian — I got some
        questions for you.

[Deacon rides out toward the destination and picks up radio chatter.]

Cpl. Elliot: O'Brian. How much longer we gonna be out here?

O'Brian: We're — we're just getting started, so cool your jets, okay? Let me
         get back to work.

Deacon: O'Brian. This has gotta be it.

O'Brian: Hey Sarge, how about we make an unscheduled stop on our way back.
         Couple of sample traps I want to check.

Cpl. Franklin: Hey doc, how long before your job's done?
O'Brian: I'm not a doctor. I keep telling you that.
Cpl. Franklin: Sorry — Lieutenant O'Brian. How long we gonna be here?

O'Brian: Long as it takes, Corporal, long as it takes. I thought I saw
         something on our approach. I'm gonna check it out.

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah?
O'Brian: It's probably nothing. Fresh carrion maybe.
Cpl. Franklin: Okay doc — Lieutenant. Don't become carrion yourself.

O'Brian: Only animals can become carrion, Corporal, not humans. You guys
         checked the perimeter, right?

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah, it's clear.

[Deacon infiltrates the LZ and shadows O'Brian and his NERO escort.]

O'Brian: Lieutenant O'Brian, Field Note Two Zero Zero Six. On approach to the
         landing site, I observed a large swarm of insects, probably Tabanus
         atratus, or Diptera, in a clearing well away from our designated
         target. From that distance, I could not discern what was attracting
         the insects, but from the size of the swarm, recent carrion is
         indicated. Should be just over here — Dammit, where is it — Ah, here
         it is. Speculation to Tabanus atratus is confirmed. Lots of horse
         flies here, glad to have the suit on, let me tell you. Carrion is
         still mostly intact and appears to be Odocoileus hermionus, or mule
         deer — as if anybody could check that. Striation of the large muscle
         masses indicate infection of Hooligan strain Hb, will take sample to
         confirm. Well, look at it this way, you poor sonofabitch, at least
         you weren't torn apart by Freaks. If you lived a few more weeks, you
         would've become one yourself. Now wouldn't that've been something.

[Deacon reaches over and unplugs O'Brian's comm unit. He contemplates fleeing,
 but Deek has him at gunpoint.]

Deacon: Uh-huh.
O'Brian: What do you want? Stay back.
Deacon: I just want to talk.

O'Brian: Uh — NERO protocol Two Dash Seven states clearly — That if —
         conducting operations in quarantine zones — That if I encounter any
         civilians, er — subj — Drift — civilians! — That I am forbidden from
         making contact —

[He taps the gun against the man's hazmat suit visor.]

Deacon: Really? See that sounded to me like — making contact.
O'Brian: Yes, yes it did.
Deacon: You're alive.
O'Brian: Yes — I am.
Deacon: How? How are you alive, O'Brian?
O'Brian? What? I — I — I don't understand —

Deacon: Okay, you were there, that night, Farewell — The next night, the
        refugee camp — The choppers were burning, everyone was dead.

O'Brian: NERO Protocol Two Dash Seven — states that I — Two Dash Seven —
Deacon: They were slaughtered — torn limb from Goddamned limb —
O'Brian: NERO — Protocol Two Dash —

Deacon: Alright, listen up. We're gonna do this the easy way or the hard way.
        The easy way, we have a little chat, you give me the information that
        I need — And you go back to digging your way through Freaker shit —
        Or whatever the hell else you're doin' out here. The hard way — I
        crack open that little space suit — And then we see what your friends
        out there have to say — About you breathing in all this "contaminated"
        air. So, what's it gonna be, O'Brian?

O'Brian: Yes. Okay — okay.

Deacon: You remember the rooftop of the old brewery. I put a woman on your
        chopper. She was wounded.

O'Brian: Yes — I remember, uh — a — a knife wound, she was — she was cut pretty
         bad.

Deacon: I went to the refugee camp, that you said you were takin' her to.
        Everyone was dead. So I'm gonna ask you again. How did you survive?

O'Brian: We weren't there. Uh — we were diverted south to another camp. Like
         you said, the — camp in Belknap was overrun, so — They moved us south,
         to a camp outside of Silver Lake.

Deacon: Were there survivors?

O'Brian: You mean now? I don't know, I — I was transferred to the research
         unit —

Deacon: Did she survive?

O'Brian: Oh — wait, wait, wait — I, I, I — I can find out. I, I can check — I
         — You — you have one of our radios. That's how you, uh — I, I can't
         promise anything — but I — I'll check —

Deacon: Uh-huh — and I'm gonna go with you. Come on.

[He wraps an arm around O'Brian and prepares to use him as a hostage.]

O'Brian: No you — you can't — please, you don't — hey, you don't understand.
         They'll fucking shoot you.

Deacon: Not before I shoot you.

O'Brian: Okay look, if you're going to fucking kill me, do it! Okay? I did my
         job. Okay, that woman — your wife? I put her on oxygen, I gave her an
         IV — I kept her alive — I got in a lotta trouble for that. She was
         septic, she wasn't gonna make it — But I got her to the MASH unit. I
         saved her Goddamned life!

Cpl. Franklin: O'Brian — report.

O'Brian: Jesus — I have to go. Please. You have to get outta here, okay? You
         don't know these men — You don't know what they're capable of —

Deacon: O'Brian — if I don't hear from you — I don't care how long it takes,
        I'm gonna track you down — And I'm gonna do a lot worse than snap off
        an antenna.

O'Brian: I'm sorry about your wife. But you're not the only one who lost
         someone that night.

[The researcher runs off and eventually leaves on the NERO chopper.]

Deacon: O'Brian — O'Brian, he's alive. How the hell is he alive? They were
        diverted south. He said that he put her on oxygen, he gave her an IV
        — he kept her alive. She was septic, so she wasn't gonna make it — but
        he got her to a MASH unit. He saved her live. He said it — he said he
        saved her life. She can still be — she can, no, no, no, no. No. But
        O'Brian is alive. And if he is — then — maybe —

Boozer: Deek — you there?

Deacon: Boozeman — um — few days ago, I asked you if you remembered that NERO
        asshole, O'Brian —

Boozer: Uh, yeah, Deek. It's — it's all — I dunno — kind of a blur —

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, okay, get some shut-eye¹ Boozeman — I — I'll tell ya about
        it later.

Boozer: When are we ridin' outta here — Deek?

Deacon: Soon, Boozer. Real soon. Look — as soon as your arm heals, we're gonna
        be ridin' the hell outta here.

Boozer: Yeah, Deek. Okay.

[Deacon fiddles with his NERO radio.]

Deacon: O'Brian — are you out there? O'Brian? Oh, you sonofabitch. You better
        radio me, you hear me, O'Brian? I know you're on this channel,
        Goddammit. Okay — you better get back to me or I'm going to track you
        down. You got that? Oh Goddammit — oh, come on¹ O'Brian. Get back to
        me.

[Boozer radios back later.]

Boozer: Deek, you there? Did you track down the chopper? Was it the same guy —
        the one we saw on the roof that night?

Deacon: Uh, yeah — yeah, it was him.

Boozer: And — did he remember us? Sarah? What happened?

Deacon: I don't know — they got diverted south. He — he remembered her — but
        he — he doesn't know what happened to her —

Boozer: You're not — wait, you don't think she's still alive?

Deacon: What? No — I mean, no — look, I'm not stupid, Boozer — I just wanna
        find out, y'know — what happened to her — where she died.

Boozer: Well, hey — maybe you can finally — I dunno — find some peace.

Deacon: I don't need to find any peace — Jesus, Boozer. I — I gotta go,
        alright? Deacon out.

Boozer: I'm fine, Goddammit — Hey Deek — we're getting low on supplies. Could
        use some more meat, if you get a chance.

Deacon: Oh, shit — okay. Uh — guess it's been awhile since we did any hunting.

[Deacon returns to Tucker after she asks him to stop by.]

Tucker: Deek — I, I need you to go after someone.
Deacon: Go after someone? Okay, what's going on?

Tucker: Right after you brought in that girl Lisa, Larsen brings in another
        one. Name was Rose Allen. A weak little thing, but we figured she
        could pull her own weight, help us get this irrigation ditch done.

Deacon: Okay, so what do — what do you need?

Tucker: She's gone. She went on a supply run with Alkai, some others, up to
        that abandoned NERO refugee camp, you know the one — I think you've
        been up there before?

Deacon: Yeah — yeah, I know the one.

Tucker: Find her, Deek. There's been a bunch of Drifters and Squatters spotted
        up that way — if they find her first —

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah okay. I'm — I'm gonna see what I can do.

[Deek goes up to the refugee camp, not far from the one with Sarah's grave.]

Deacon: Deacon St. John to Salome Hot Springs. Tuck, are you there?
Tucker: Yeah Deek, I'm here.

Deacon: Hey, I'm at that location — where the girl was last seen. Looks like
        they, uh — got hit by a Swarm. If she was here — probably not much
        chance she's still alive.

Tucker: If she is, you'll find her. Tucker out.

[Deacon immediately meets the inhabitants -- swarmers.]

Deacon: Oh, Goddammit, Swarmers. Okay — let's take a look around. Oh God, what
        happened to ya, Rose? Huh?

[He studies some clues.]

Deacon: Alright — what've we got — I mean — might be here somewhere, right?
        Oh Jesus — looks like the Swarm tore 'em apart — poor bastards.

[With nowhere else to look, he climbs the radio tower and finds the captured

Deacon: Rose — Rose Allen — right?
Rose: No — no —

Deacon: Hey, hey, hey, hey — I'm not gonna hurt you, see? I'm — I'm not with
        those assholes.

Rose: No! No!

Deacon: Goddammit, I'm here to help. Tucker sent me. Wait, wait, I said that I
        am here to help you.

Rose: No. You're with her. You're from the work camp.
Deacon: No, no, I'm with Tucker — I, uh, I — I do runs for her, yeah.
Rose: They starve me. I wouldn't follow her orders, so they wouldn't feed me.
Deacon: Well, I mean, it's a work camp. I mean, everyone's gotta work.

Rose: I'm not a slave. I'm not goin' back, do you hear me? I'd rather die out
      here!

Deacon: Okay! Okay, okay. Goddammit. Go on.

[Deek lets Rose leave the site.]

Deacon: Tucker — Tucker, Deacon St. John to — Deacon St. John to Ada Tucker.
Tucker: Deek — did you find her?
Deacon: Uh —  yeah. Yeah, Tuck, I found her. And — uh — she's on her way back.
Tucker: Wait — you let her go? Alone?

Deacon: Well — she took one of the Squatter's¹ bikes — she — said she was gonna
        be able to find her way — look, she didn't want my help.

Tucker: Goddammit Deek, you should have brought her in!

Deacon: Well why, Tuck — why? Is — is something wrong? I mean is there some
        reason she wouldn't wanna come back?

Tucker: No — no, of course not. It's just — a kid like Rose — she doesn't have
        a Goddamn clue about what's out there.

Deacon: Well — I don't know, Tuck, maybe she does. St. John out.

[Soon after the Rose incident, Tuck radios in again.]

Tucker: Deek — thank God. You've gotta go after him now. They're getting away.

Deacon: Go after who, Tuck? Slow down.

Tucker: It's Roach, it's Roach — you know him, he used to ride with Leon and
        Alvarez, but I trusted him.

Deacon: Oh Goddammit¹ Tuck, you shouldn't have.

Tucker: No. He's taken the rest of our drugs and headed north. My boys lost
        him somewhere around Marion Forks.

Deacon: Alright. I'll see if I can track him down.

[In Marion Forks, he looks at some clues in a ruin.]

Deacon: Gotta take a closer look. Which way — Still got this —

[The biker rides by.]

Deacon: Tucker, I spotted him, and it looks like he was — uh — like he was
        waiting for someone.

Tucker: Deek, don't let him get away. I want him alive.
Deacon: What the — shit, Tucker. Alive?

Tucker: More shit has come up missing. I need him to tell us where he's stashed
        it.

Deacon: Okay — shit, alright. I'll see what I can do. Oh — come on, Roach —
        where do ya think you're going? I'm still back here, you sonofabitch —

[He and his other riders start firing on Deek.]

Deacon: Fine, alright — let's do this the hard way — Roach, slow down, I just
        wanna talk —

Roach: Yeah? That why Tucker sent you? To talk?
Deacon: Well yeah, Goddammit, if I wanted to kill ya, you'd be dead —
Roach: Up your ass — I know what you done to Leon and Alvarez!

Deacon: Where ya goin'? You can't get away! Don't let him get away, Deek —
        Roach, are you late for somethin'? Where ya goin'?

Roach: To hell with you, St. John!
Deacon: I got you — sonofabitch!

[Deacon captures Roach.]

Deacon: Hey Roach — how's it going, buddy? See? Told ya I wasn't gonna kill
        ya —

Roach: Deek — no — no — I — I — I didn't do nothin' —

Deacon: Nah, that's not what Tucker says — I guess when Leon and Alvarez took
        off with the camp's drugs, they forgot to cut you in, is that about it?

Roach: Deek — no —

Deacon: No, no, no — clue me in on what you're thinkin'¹ man, I — I wanna
        understand. You — you took what was left? While the old woman wasn't
        lookin'?

Roach: Deek — I got nothin' on me, okay? Search me —

Deacon: No, I'm not — that's not my job. I'm gonna leave that up to Alkai.
        Hey, Tuck, I got him. Mark down these coordinates and have Alkai send
        some men.

Tucker: He's alive? Did he have my drugs?

Deacon: Well — yeah, he's alive. But if you want him to stay that way, Alkai —
        he better hurry up and get off his ass. St. John out.

        mentioned having one.

Boozer: Shit, I don't know. Check the gift shop at Belknap Crater. I dunno —
        maybe Marion Forks?

Deacon: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

[Deacon rides out to the old Belknap Crater tourist trap.]

Deacon: Gift shop. Gotta be one in here somewhere.

Deacon: Lisa, I, uh —
Lisa: Go away.
Deacon: Brought you something.
Lisa: It's beautiful. Will you take me with you? Take me back to Marion Forks?
Deacon: Look, I — I can't. Because it's not safe —

Deacon: Hey, uh — You're not answering the radio.
Boozer: Yep. Dunno, I was —

[Boozer seems woozy.]

Deacon: Whoa, hold on, hold on —
Boozer: No, I'm alright, I'm alright! Just — Tryin' to get clear, you know?
Deacon: You're burning up.
Boozer: Ugh, my head's poundin' like a mother.
Deacon: You're burning up.
Boozer: Nah, nah, nah. I'm just — I'm just tired.
Deacon: Okay, stay here. Rest. I'll think of something.
Boozer: Look, I don't need a Goddamn babysitter. I'm fine.
Deacon: Shit. C'mon. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, think.

[He reminisces about an outing with Sarah years back.]

Sarah: Here, come here, I'll show you what you're looking for.

[He stares at her ass when she bends over to look at a plant.]

Deacon: Yep, found it.
Sarah: Alright, c'mon¹ focus.
Deacon: I am focused.
Sarah: Alright, so this one is called Lavandula angustifolia.
Deacon: Lavender?

Sarah: Yes, well I'm still paying off my student loans, so I will stick with
       Latin — But you can call it that.

Deacon: Mm-hmm. Yeah, get your money's worth. Go for it.

Sarah: Okay, c'mon, give me your hands. Alright, so you wanna put one hand
       around the flower —

Deacon: Alright.
Sarah: And then put the other hand at the stem.
Deacon: Okay.
Sarah: Just like that. And then you pull nice and slow —
Deacon: You know, I've pulled weeds before.
Sarah: Excuse me, sir, this is not a weed. You have to be gentle.
Deacon: But apply pressure.
Sarah: Oh yeah, but not too hard. Okay, ready?
Deacon: Uh-huh.
Sarah: Go. There you go, that's perfect.
Deacon: And it doesn't smell very good.
Sarah: Okay, you hold onto those and I'm gonna collect more.
Deacon: So, uh — why lavender?

Sarah: Well the guys at the lab are pretty excited. They — they think they have
       this sub-species which might have mutated monoterpenoids, which produce
       a modified linalool that —

Deacon: That is so — oh my — thank you, Einstein — thank you.

Sarah: Sorry — it has a chemical that we can use to synthesize new medicine —
       for burn patients.

Deacon: Where I'm from, the only weed used for medicine is the kind that you
        smoke. You know, Boozer knows a guy with a farm, it's about three miles
        up the road.

Sarah: Oh, that's great! Boozer's going to wind up in prison and take you with
       him.

Deacon: So what else do you guys make? Like, chemical weapons, WMDs, shit like
        that?

Sarah: No. No, no, no. Well — at least, not me —
Deacon: Yeah?

Sarah: It's in my contract. None of my research can be used for military
       purposes. Hey, there's more over here!

[She runs towards the water and prepares to strip down and swim across.]

Deacon: Wait, stop. Yeah —
Sarah: Oh c'mon, the water's gonna be great!
Deacon: Hold — hold on, hold on.
Sarah: What's wrong?
Deacon: Well I — I didn't mean stop that.
Sarah: C'mon, what is it?
Deacon: It's a long story.
Sarah: Well, it's okay. We can just walk. I like walking.
Deacon: So, why don't you tell me about your plants.
Sarah: Really? Okay — well this particular genus is adventitious.
Deacon: You want me to ask.
Sarah: It means, "not native to this area." You can thank Ogden for that.
Deacon: Who? Oh, shit — I asked.

Sarah: Peter Skene Ogden, first explorer to come through this part of Oregon.
       He and some of the other early explorers brought all their medicinal
       herbs and plants with them. Some got away — and — now they're growing
       here. Mostly along the shores of small lakes and ponds.

Deacon: First white explorer.
Sarah: Wow, look at you. Being all politically correct.

Deacon: Don't buy into all the biker stereotypes you see on tv. We are actually
        quite charming.

Sarah: I bet.
Deacon: The MC's got a couple of brothers, one fully patched.

Sarah: I don't think I've seen one person of color since I arrived in your —
       strange little backwater paradise.

Deacon: Yeah, Jack actually had some guys bussed in from Sacramento, just to
        piss off our skinhead rivals.

Sarah: He did not.

Deacon: No, he did not — I'm kidding. Jersey Jim's an old buddy of mine,
        patched him in myself. We served in the same unit. Come by the
        clubhouse some day, I'll show you around. You'd like the guy — he's
        funny as shit. He makes a mean margarita.

Sarah: Well, I have to be in the lab early on Monday, so —
Deacon: I'll have us back in your bed by ten, I promise.
Sarah: How can I refuse an offer like that?

[They cross a bridge and reach the lavender shore.]

Sarah: Okay, you try picking some now.
Deacon: Lavender — you — you want me to pick lavender?
Sarah: Yep. And bring me three plants — and don't crush them.
Deacon: Oh, I'm gonna crush 'em —
Sarah: Come on —
Deacon: Uh — got one —
Sarah: Good for you!
Deacon: This one?
Sarah: Yep. Keep going.
Deacon: Last one —
Sarah: Great — bring 'em here —

[Deacon surprises Sarah by giving her a different purple flower.]

Sarah: Oh!
Deacon: For you.
Sarah: Wow, gallantry is alive in Farewell after all.
Deacon: Well, if he's not, then I didn't kill him.

[He goes in for a kiss but almost smushes the flowers.]

Sarah: Hey! Aww, poor guys.
Deacon: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Hey — is that the one we're gonna smoke later?

Sarah: No, but this is the one we're gonna drink. I make this killer herbal
       tea with it.

Deacon: I'll bet.

Sarah: Hey. Alright, if you come over then I will make it for you. As long as
       you give me a ride home.

Deacon: Alright, great.
Sarah: You're gonna be a believer.
Deacon: And we'll grab a beer for myself on the way over.

Boozer: Uh, sorry. I'm a little out of it. What — you said somethin'?

Deacon: It's, uh — it's something Sarah showed me, a few summers ago — before
        — yeah, anyway, uh — there's a plant that grows out here called
        lavender. It grows in the shade, along rivers — lake shores. I'm gonna
        see if I can find some.

Boozer: Shit¹ brother, the way my arm's feelin', I'll try anything. But fuck
        the lavender, bring somethin' I can smoke.

Deacon: Whatever, I'm gonna find some of this shit, I'm gonna make a burn salve
        out of it, and you're gonna shut the hell up about it.

Boozer: Yeah, okay. Sorry¹ brother. Just — goin' stir crazy up here, you know?

Boozer: Goddammit.

Deacon: Uh, it's a funny thing, I — I was remembering how — Uh, a few summers
        back Sarah took me out to Bear Creek. We were picking lavender, and uh
        — she taught — 

Boozer: Pussy.
Deacon: She taught me how to make this salve for burns and um —

Boozer: Look, I got out today. Okay? I actually had a look around the mountain,
        I cleared some traps. Look, arm's almost as good as new.

Deacon: Alright. Okay. I'm just gonna leave it right here.

Boozer: Hey, just gimme a couple days. Okay? Just — We'll ride up north, like
        you said, and get out of this shithole.

Deacon: Goddamn Rippers.
Tucker: That little gal you were so worried about?
Deacon: Yeah, Lisa? Wait, hold on — what happened — where's Lisa?

Tucker: Gone. They took her and three others. Alkai followed 'em as far as he
        could, but they're holed up at Belknap Crater. He came back to round
        up more men, but —

Deacon: Goddammit. Okay, look — I've seen what those sonsofbitches do to
        hostages. I'm not waiting.

        her. And — Addy's — she's good, she's got medicine — if, you know, to

 subtitles, even though older versions of the game do. Not sure why this is.]

Deacon: Uh — Lisa, this is, uh, Rikki. She's gonna, uh, take you to a safe
        place.

Rikki: Nothing has changed, Deek. Iron Mike is not gonna pay you for this.

Deacon: Pay me for — oh, c'mon, that's not — excuse me — that's not what this
        is about. It's not about collecting a bounty or anything. Can you just
        please take her? Huh?

Rikki: Mm-hmm. What's wrong with her, Deek?

Deacon: What's wrong with her? She was — had a run-in with some Rippers, I had
        to —

Rikki: Oh my God. Hey, Lisa. Hi. I'm Rikki. Listen, do you like to go fishing?
       I love fishing, it's — it's my favorite thing in the whole wide world.
       Would you wanna go fishing with me? Yeah? C'mon, I'm gonna tell you
       about Lost Lake. It has the clearest water you have ever seen. And the
       fish — oh my God — the fish in the morning? They jump this high. I'll

Deacon: No, Tuck, no — the — the uh — Rippers cut her up pretty bad. And she

Tucker: Goddammit. We needed her — now the digging's going to get even further
        behind.

Deacon: Well, look on the bright side, Tuck — one less mouth to feed, yeah?

Tucker: You get out there and find me some warm bodies or there won't be any
        mouths left to feed. Tucker out.

Deacon: Yeah, okay, I'm gonna get right on that.

[Deacon returns to the safehouse for some sleep. He awakens to Boozer standing
 with his shotgun pointed at the doorway, clearly in a hallucinating state.]

Boozer: Oh they're comin', they're comin¹, oh they're gonna — They wanna, no
        — I mean they're on me, they're gonna —

[He puts Deacon in his crosshairs.]

Deacon: Oh shit, Boozer, what's going on?
Boozer: No! How'd you get in here?
Deacon: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa —
Boozer: You stay right there! You stay there.
Deacon: Boozer, it's me. It's Deek. Let's just calm down.
Boozer: Don't you come any closer. I will kill you.
Deacon: Let's just talk. It's alright.
Deacon: C'mon, give me the gun! Give me the gun, buddy! C'mon. C'mon!
Boozer: No! No — No, I will not —

[The gun discharges upwards and Boozer falls down, seemingly sobered.]

Deacon: Oh shit. Oh Jesus Christ. Boozer, what the fuck —
Boozer: I, heard — I heard 'em. I heard voices —
Deacon: Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shit.
Boozer: I mean, Deek, you — you heard 'em, right?
Deacon: No, I didn't hear shit! Boozer, you've got blood poisoning.
Boozer: No, I — I do not.
Deacon: Yes you do, Boozer. Just take a look.
Boozer: I don't need to take a look, I'm —
Deacon: C'mon, we gotta get you some help.
Boozer: Look, I don't need some —
Deacon: C'mon.

Boozer: Dammit, I don't need help.

[They start walking to Deacon's bike.]

Boozer: Sorry 'bout that — 'bout tryin' to blow your head off — I mean — I
        thought I saw somethin' — ya know?

Deacon: Easy. Hey, watch the steps.
Boozer: I got this. But it — it was — it was in my head — ya know?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.

Boozer: I could hear 'em, Deek. I — I could hear 'em — Deek. Footsteps — just
        — poundin' in my head — boots —

Deacon: Just a few more steps.
Boozer: I don't need any help. I can Goddamn walk. I can — walk.
Deacon: Okay. Okay.

Boozer: I — I just — I don't — I don't know — what happened — I — I saw 'em —
        so many of 'em, just — all comin', ya know?

Deacon: Yeah. Now, c'mon, c'mon. Get on. We gotta go.
Boozer: Wait — wait, wait — what? Where're we goin'? I — I don't —
Deacon: It's just a short ride. Boozer, it'll help clear your head.
Boozer: Ride? Uh, yeah, yeah. Okay — that'd be — good. Air. Okay —

[Boozer rides on Deacon's bike as they set off from O'Leary Mountain.]

Boozer: Where — we goin' — Deek?
Deacon: Do you remember when we first rode outta Farewell? What that was like?
Boozer: Yeah — I — remember.

Deacon: The highways were — they were all choked up with cars, there were so
        many people — all on the move. Thinkin' that — if they could only go
        fast enough, that they'd outrun what was coming.

Boozer: Yeah —

Deacon: No one could move fast enough, Boozer. No one saw it comin' the way I
        did. So by the time they said, "fuck it," you know¹ and started
        walking, and then running — it was too late.

Boozer: Yeah — too — late.

Deacon: And I remember — watchin' the Freaks — watchin' them all come —
        thousands of 'em — and all those — all those dumbshits — just got
        swallowed up.

Boozer: Yeah — I remember.

Deacon: When you see a thing like that — you know it's only a matter of time —
        before it's our turn. And nothing's gonna stop it, Boozer. Not a
        Goddamn thing. But — but do you know why we keep going?

Boozer: No.
Deacon: Because what the hell else are we gonna do?
Boozer: Yeah.

[Deacon drives to a small campsite overlooking Iron Mike's Lost Lake resort.
 They make camp and Deacon sets to work chopping off his beard.]

Boozer: What are you doin'?
Deacon: Nothin'.
Boozer: Uh-huh. Figured you'd get all prettied up before headin' in.

Deacon: Well, you know. Yeah, I figured I'd — Stop in the lodge, have a few
        beers, and then just stroll into the infirmary. No, no, no, man¹ I'm
        just — Just sick of it.

Boozer: Okay. I'm just fuckin' with you. Hey, Deek. Iron Mike said — he'd kill
        ya if he ever saw you again. And if he said it —

Deacon: That old man doesn't remember his name half the time.
Boozer: No, no, no. He'll remember —

Deacon: Hey — Hey. You gotta stay awake. We're off the open road, but if a
        Freaker wanders by —

Boozer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Alright. Hey Deek?
Deacon: Yeah?
Boozer: Don't you kill anyone in the camp, okay?
Deacon: I'm not gonna kill anyone. You good?
Boozer: Never better.

[Deacon sets out to infiltrate the large township. There are guards patrolling
 all over, including two near the campsite.]

LJ: What the hell, man? Let's go back. There's nothing here.
Tommy: You heard the bike, same as me.

LJ: Prob'ly some Drifter. Not worth draggin' me out here. Shit, we're supposed
    to guard the camp, not wander around jerkin' off.

Tommy: Coulda been Rippers.
LJ: Oh, against the two of us? Really.
Tommy: We could get 'em before they —

LJ: No, no, no, no. See, that's what we thought, too. Me and this guy, Addy's
    brother, we went out on patrol — you know, not far from here really. We
    kept to the shadows. It was night, but the moon was out. And you know
    Rippers love the night. We heard 'em coming, first. Shriekin' like
    Freakers, they were comin' straight outta hell. God, that sound. There
    were maybe four we could see. So we open up on 'em. They don't — they
    don't even try not to get shot. Thing is, they weren't goin' down. They
    just kept runnin' at us. My boy got one of 'em down, pulled his knife to
    finish the job. Shit, I should've told him to forget it. Two others climbed
    right on him, and I — fired.

Tommy: You fired?

LJ: Yeah, I killed him. They were tearin' him apart like Goddamn Freakers. I
    fired and got the hell outta there. So, you go after Rippers, you better
    have backup.

[Deacon stalks the patrolmen as they return through the marsh. Other sentries
 stand near a campfire.]

Ace: Nice 'n' boring guard duty. The way it should be. What're you gonna do
     later?

Kincade: Gonna try to get some sleep, that's what. That girl — Lisa, whatever.
         The new one? She cries all the damn time. First few days, she kept me
         up all night — what's her deal?

Ace: She just came in from the shit, whaddya want?
Kincade: Shit, even money, we kick her to the curb before a month's out.
Ace: Iron Mike won't go for that.
Kincade: He doesn't pay that much attention. Does he even know she's here?
Ace: Think she's hard to miss. She does cry all the time.

Kincade: But she has been quiet lately. Maybe she got wise that that wasn't
         gonna help.

Ace: Yeah, actually, I haven't seen her in awhile.

[Under cover of darkness, Deacon slips further into the camp.]

Slim: Have a little faith. Iron Mike says we got nothin' to worry about now.
      The truce with the Rippers will hold.

Jim: How the hell you gonna keep the peace with a bunch of crazy-ass lunatics,
     who cut themselves? How can you trust anything like that?

Slim: Any thing¹? These are people, not Freakers.

Jim: That's debatable. Skizzo's right. The only thing these assholes understand
     is force. We sign a peace treaty like we're the goddamn UN, we show 'em
     we're weak.

[Even further in, Skizzo and Iron Mike are discussing and wandering around.]

Deacon: Oh shit. Iron Mike, Skizzo — sonofabitch.

Skizzo: Mike, the men in there, they weren't just attacked — they were
        tortured. Joe's got scars all along his head, like they were trying to
        scalp him.

Iron Mike: Raymond?

Skizzo: And the men we buried? They were butchered, Mike, butchered. Christ,
        it took us three hours to rake up all the body parts. I didn't want to
        leave 'em for the Freaks.

Iron Mike: Raymond?

Skizzo: It's Carlos and you know it. We gotta hit 'em back or the Rippers are
        gonna —

Iron Mike: Raymond — Skizzo! Leave it be. Just leave it — be.

Skizzo: And what about the next group, Mike? And the next? Hell, Carlos is
        already pushing into Rogue Camp, Camp Pioneer.

Iron Mike: There's no proof of that.

Skizzo: They're moving up north. I heard one of those Radio Free Oregon
        broadcasts — claims they got hit by Rippers.

Iron Mike: Oh, so now you're listening to that nut job Copeland.

Skizzo: Well he may be a nut job, but I think he'd know a Ripper if one was
        comin' at him with a butcher knife.

[Deacon trails the two until they finish walking near the infirmary.]

Skizzo: They're not here. But you can go in, an' see for yourself.

Iron Mike: We'll come back. You know Addy don't like it, you snooping around
           in her business.

Skizzo: Hey, you said it, not me.

Iron Mike: I'm not laughing. Now c'mon — come back later when Addy's here. I
           wanna talk to those men myself.

Skizzo: Well let's just hope they're still breathing.

Iron Mike: Addy'll take care of 'em.

[The two walk uphill towards the lodge, leaving the infirmary's grounds.]

Deacon: There it is. I just gotta find a way inside.

[Other nighttime guards are nearby with the latest camp scuttlebutt.]

Mark: You think, uh — Addy and Rikki are a thing?
Nader: Why, you tryna get with them, or is this thing goin' into your bank?

Mark: Nah, man, I'm just curious. I was on kitchen duty, and I saw Rikki
      lookin' — fine, just — just great. She came outta her cabin, and two
      seconds later, out comes Addy. Think she had a smile on.

Nader: Well, that's gonna end in shit.
Mark: Why you say that?
Nader: Skizzo's taken a shine to her.
Mark: To — Addy?
Nader: Hell no. She'd take his head off. Rikki.
Mark: Really?
Nader: Can't imagine Rikki's go for him. If she goes for guys.

[Deacon finally finds a moment to surreptitiously jimmy the clinic's latch. As
 he's about to steal some antibiotics, Rikki and Addy come in.]

Deacon: Ah, dammit. Hi, Rikki. Hi, Addy. Uh — I don't want any trouble, so if
        you ladies just step aside, I'll show my way out —

Addy: No, no, what the hell are you doing in my infirmary?
Deacon: What the hell — what're you doing — nuh-uh.

Rikki: Oh, are you going to shoot me now? Oh wait, wait, there's a code, right?
       You can't shoot a woman unless you have to.

[She quickly draws on him.]

Rikki: Well, now you have to.

[Deacon thinks about it and holsters his weapon.]

Deacon: Ah shit. Okay, look, why don't you just let me explain.

Rikki: Check what's in the cooler. What, are you selling narcotics for Tucker
       now? Y'know, when you brought me that girl, I thought you had changed.
       But clearly you haven't.

Addy: No, it's not narcotics. It's antibiotics.
Rikki: What?
Deacon: Boozer's — sick. He's got blood poisoning. I had no place else to go.
Rikki: Blood poisoning? What happened?
Addy: Does it matter?
Deacon: I fucked up.
Addy: Bring him in. Go and get him. Bring him here.
Rikki: No, we can't do that —

Addy: Yes, we can. Look, I don't care who he is, and I don't care what Iron
      Mike thinks. When a man is sick, a man is sick. We have to look after
      each other. Baby, it's all we got.

[She lowers her weapon and heads out the door.]

Rikki: C'mon, I'll give you a ride. Which way we headed?

Deacon: You remember there was a small camp, when we first rode into the
        valley?

Rikki: Yeah, I remember.

Deacon: You call this a bike?

Rikki: It may not be a fancy "Drifter" bike, but it gets the job done. Get on.

[They leave camp.]

Deacon: So how's she doing? The girl that I brought in, Lisa. Are you — are
        you gonna take me to see her?

Rikki: No.

Deacon: Goddammit Rikki — what the hell — why not?

Rikki: I can't. She's not here.

Deacon: Wait, wait — hold on a second, what? Where is she?

Rikki: A few days ago, Skizzo assigned her to a scavenge run. She and three
       others headed over to the Rogue Camp to look for supplies. They came
       back without her.

Deacon: You're telling me they left her — they left her out in the shit?

Rikki: They didn't leave anyone. They said she ran off.

Deacon: Jesus!

Rikki: It could have been anything. Wolves, Freaks, Rippers — choose your
       poison.

Deacon: And what — what was Skizzo thinking, sending her out on a supply run?

Rikki: Everyone's gotta work, Deek — that's the deal — and you know it.

Deacon: I don't believe this shit, look — she'd been surviving in Marion Forks
        for years when I found her.

Rikki: Yeah? Then maybe you should've left her there.

[They pull into Boozer's campsite.]

Boozer: Who's there? Get back — don't make me blow you Goddamn head off.
Deacon: Hey Boozer — it's me.
Boozer: No, get back!

Rikki: Oh. Hey — Hey, it's uh, it's Rikki. You remember me? I rode with you
       guys a year ago.

Boozer: Rikki — Tumalo?
Rikki: Yeah.
Boozer: That's, uh — Tumalo to — to Lost Lake?
Rikki: Yeah — yeah, man.
Deacon: Hold — hold up — hold up.
Rikki: That's right. How — how you doin' there — Boozer? You doin' alright?
Boozer: Oh — just peachy.
Rikki: It still didn't give you the right to steal our shit.
Deacon: Are you kidding me? Look at his arm, what was I supposed to do? Huh?

Rikki: I — I don't know — maybe ask. Jesus. Look at you guys, the biker boys.
       The most badass Drifters in the shit, right? And now you come back
       crawling to Iron Mike — Oh wait — if he'll let you. C'mon. Just help me
       get him back to Addy. Let's go.

Deacon: C'mon, pal. Let's —
Boozer: Don't need your help. Rikki.
Rikki: Yeah, Boozer. Rikki.

[Boozer hops on back of Deacon's bike as they ride back.]

Boozer: Wait, where — where are we goin'?

Deacon: Addy said — she's agreed to — to take a look at your arm, and — and
        see what she can do —

Boozer: What — no! No, you're not taking me to some Goddamn camp. I can ride,
        dammit —

Deacon: We're not — dammit, Boozer, it's just for a few days. Get some shit for
        your arm and then —

Boozer: No — you know what it's like there, Deek.

Deacon: No, you're not thinkin' straight — this isn't the Hot Springs, this is
        Lost Lake — Iron Mike, remember him?

Boozer: Iron Mike? He's gonna get us killed. You said —

Deacon: That was a long time ago, they built the place up — they — they got
        more people —

Boozer: We're all gonna fuckin' die —

Deacon: We'll be long gone before anything like that happens — Camp's got the
        only doc in a hundred miles. Now, Addy — look, she'll take care of it —

Boozer: Just — just a couple'a days. Yeah, then we ride the hell outta here —
        Ride north, like you said — get the hell away from all this —

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah — we ride north. Leave all this shit behind.

[Later, after Boozer gets situated in the clinic...]

Addy: Okay, so — I'm gonna go back and check on him and — Make sure he's okay.

Rikki: Coward.

Addy: Yeah, you got that right.

Deacon: Uh, how long? Um — until he can ride, I mean.

Addy: You mean, "How long do you have to be here?" Look, we have antibiotics,
      but — it's not enough. If Iron Mike lets you stay — your friend will have
      a chance.

[Deek walks with Rikki up to Iron Mike's lodge.]

Rikki: So what happened? How'd he burn his arm like that?

Deacon: We ran into some Rippers, south of Belknap — Guess they didn't like
        his tattoos.

Rikki: Jesus — I've heard about 'em doing shit like that to themselves, but
       not to people they're trying to recruit —

Deacon: Boozer wasn't any Goddamn recruit.

Rikki: Uh, guess Tucker shoulda made a deal with them like Iron Mike —

Deacon: C'mon, Rikki, just — he doesn't get it. Carlos isn't going to honor
        some deal with Lost Lake — not for long anyway, and Mike — he just
        doesn't see it.

Rikki: He sees more than you think. You've always had your good side, Deek —
       you've just been doing your best to kill it.

Deacon: Thanks for the vote of confidence.

[They enter the lodge; Skizzo is already there, discussing something.]

Skizzo: You cannot believe a word he's going to say. Addy is soft. Mike, we
        do not have enough for those that pull their own weight, let alone a
        Goddamn cripple.

Deacon: He's not a cripple. He can work. He —
Iron Mike: Oh, hold on.
Skizzo: I say we throw them out on their asses.
Rikki: Mike, that is not who we are —

Skizzo: Jesus. Listen to you. And you — You tired of bein' Tucker's little
        bitch, finally? Huh?

Rikki: Raymond, stop it —
Skizzo: Don't call me that.
Deacon: I'm pretty tired alright —

[Deacon draws on him and Skizzo does the same.]

Iron Mike: Alright, enough!
Skizzo: See? See?! You know who the fuck this guy is and you know what he's —
Iron Mike: You hold on! And you? You put that shit away.
Rikki: Mike — Deacon was the one that brought me the girl —

Iron Mike: I know. I know. And I know what kind of man he is, what he's done.
           He done any worse than you? Rikki? How 'bout me? We've all been out
           in the shit, Skizzo. We've all done things we're not proud of.

Rikki: We need another rider.
Deacon: Oh now wait a minute — I just need a few days and some antibiotics.

[Rikki, who was just sticking up for him, gets exasperated and turns away.]

Deacon: I'll do whatever it takes.
Skizzo: Sure, Mike. Whatever you say. I'm on board.
Iron Mike: Walk with me.

[They leave and let the other two fight amongst themselves. Some of this chat
 lacks subtitles, so I winged it.]

Rikki: I don't trust you —
Skizzo: Don't start with me. So, you're the one who brought him in?
Rikki: I didn't "bring" him in. Boozer needed help.
Skizzo: But he broke into the infirmary!

Rikki: The tackle shop isn't exactly secure. You were supposed to fix that
       weeks ago.

Skizzo: Oh, so what, you're hooked up with Addy, so now I gotta go over and
        fix her locks?

Rikki: Isn't that your job?

Skizzo: No, it's not my job. My job is keeping the camp safe. Addy's job is
        keeping the drugs safe.

Rikki: Sure, whatever.
Skizzo: Don't tell me how to do my job.

[Outside...]

Iron Mike: Rikki told me you stopped runnin' for Tucker. Sent that little girl
           here instead.

Deacon: I'm sorry I lied to you, before, about doing runs for Tucker.
Iron Mike: How long you been driftin'? You and Bill?
Deacon: I don't know. Like I said, time gets lost.

Iron Mike: If folks don't put down some roots, figure this shit out, grow some
           food, come next spring? Won't be none of us left.

Deacon: If you give Boozer what he needs, let us hole up here 'til he can
        ride — like I said, I'll do whatever you need. I just, I — I want you
        to know that as soon as he's patched up — we're gonna put together some
        gear, we're gonna ride north.

Iron Mike: North, huh?

Deacon: There's a camp up there, near Smith Rock — Boozer's never been there,
        anyway. Got a lot of ghosts down here. It's time we move on.

Iron Mike: Fresh start, eh? Yeah, I can respect that. Alright — don't make me
           regret this, Deek. Now go on, leave me be. I got some thinkin' to
           do.

Deacon: Sure¹ Mike, yeah, whatever you say — just — have Rikki radio me if you
        need something.

[Later, if Deacon wanders toward Blair's merchant stall:]

Blair: Deek, Deek, Deek — what's been keeping you away so long?
Deacon: Blair — how ya doing?

Blair: Hey, I gotta ask you. I heard you riding in last night, with Rikki and
       uh — who's that guy?

Deacon: Boozer, or his name is William or Bill — I've always just called him
        Boozer. Don't ask why.

Blair: I wasn't — I mean — is he gonna be okay? I stopped by to say hi to Addy
       — he didn't look so good.

Deacon: Yeah, he's gonna be fine. Soon as he's patched up, we're riding north,
        you got that? So just drop it. Okay?

[He looks at her list.]

Deacon: Hmm, a Liston knife?

Addy: Yeah, it was used by doctors in the Civil War to perform operations in
      the field.

Deacon: Operations?

Addy: Yeah, y'know, when they didn't have anesthesia or laudanum. I wrote down
      where you might be able to find one. It's the brochure for — the
      visitor's center at Sherman's Camp, yeah.

Deacon: Sherman's Camp. Yeah, the place crawling with all the Freakers. I'll
        see what I can do.

Addy: Yeah — I — Deacon — Thank you.

[He leaves the clinic.]

Deacon: I gotta find a Liston knife — Head to — Sherman's Camp — place is gonna
        be crawlin'.

[He can see the Freaker-infested hellhole from a high road.]

Deacon: Sherman's Camp — gettin' close — Here it is —

[He finds the boarded-up destination.]

Deacon: Visitor's center. Gotta find a way inside.

[He shoots the latch off the fire escape and enters.]

Deacon: Gotta be in here somewhere. Down here — Not much left — this place has
        been picked over clean —

[He smashes an exhibit to find the knife.]

Deacon: Liston knife. This is it. Gotta get it back to Addy.

[Deek rides back.]

Deacon: Addy, I got that knife you were lookin' for.
Addy: Thank you¹ Deacon. You have no idea how badly we need this.
Deacon: No problem. Glad to help.

[He makes it back to Lost Lake.]

Addy: Hey.
Deacon: Oh. Here's that knife you were looking for.
Addy: Thank you so much.
Deacon: Yeah, no problem.

[While doing "Sherman's Camp is Crawling," the NERO radio springs to life.]

O'Brian: Hello? Is anyone on this channel?
Deacon: O'Brian? Is that you?

O'Brian: Yes — yeah. It's — it's O'Brian. You still have one of our radios.
         Good. Okay. Look. I'm gonna try and help you — find out about the
         woman —

Deacon: Sarah Whitaker. I put her on your chopper that night —

O'Brian: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. Okay. But first, you gotta do something for
         me.

Deacon: Wait, what? You need something from me.

O'Brian: Look, there's a digital display on your radio. I'm going to send you
         a coded message. Coordinates. Meet me at that location.

Deacon: O'Brian — what the hell's this all about?

O'Brian: Just meet me there. There will be NERO soldiers all around me, like
         before,¹ don't let them see you. O'Brian out.

[Deacon heads for the NERO site.]

Deacon: Alright — I'm here.
O'Brian: Jesus — don't — don't sneak up on me like that.

Deacon: Did you find out anything about Sarah — about the woman I put on your
        chopper?

O'Brian: Nothing.
Deacon: Nothing?

O'Brian: Hey, hey — wait, wait, wait, wait. It's gonna take some time, okay?
         I'm risking my neck here. If anyone back — back at HQ finds out?
         Those — those guys with the guns over there? They follow orders
         without question.

Deacon: You're all — on the same team, O'Brian.

O'Brian: Look — it just looks that way. Look, I don't have time to explain it
         right now, but — It's why I need your help.

Deacon: My help —

O'Brian: Look, just take it. It's a — it's a — Wavelength recorder and some
         GPS trackers. I just need you to — We're outta time. Look — shit, I
         don't even know your name.

Deacon: Deacon — Deacon St. John.

O'Brian: Yeah, well look — Deacon St. John — If you want me to risk my neck
         helping you find whatever-her-name — uh, Sarah? Then yeah, I'm gonna
         need you to do something for me. Okay. Keep that radio close. I'll
         contact you in a couple minutes.

[O'Brian leaves the package with Deacon and amscrays.]

Deacon: You don't even know my name — well you're gonna know it before we're
        done, O'Brian. And keep the radio close — it's been right here the
        whole time, you sonofabitch. Jesus Christ — how long do I have to wait
        now —

O'Brian: Hello, you there? Deacon?
Deacon: Yeah, I'm here. Now what's this all about? What do you want?
O'Brian: Alright, I put a blocker on this channel. It's secure.
Deacon: What do you want?

O'Brian: I've sent a series of coordinates to your radio. I need you to go to
         those locations and —

Deacon: What? Why?

O'Brian: Just listen to me. There are several NERO task groups doing work in
         the field. I need to know what they're doing.

Deacon: Then why don't you ask them?

O'Brian: I can't. Look. I said it's a long story and I don't have time to get
         into it right now. Let's just say, the men above me, way above me,
         are running a lot of field missions, all separate from each other.
         Nobody knows what anybody else is doing.

Deacon: So the world ends and you assholes carry on like nothing's changed.
        Where?

O'Brian: I sent you the coordinates.
Deacon: Okay, Jesus — O'Brian — alright, I will see what I can do.

O'Brian: Just — get to as many of them as you can. There are active LZs,
         landing sites, sample drop off locations —

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, I got it. But you better have something for me, O'Brian.

O'Brian: Yeah, yeah — I got it too. Hold on — Drifter — One of our helos is
         heading toward your position now. You have to follow it.

Deacon: Follow it? Why?
O'Brian: Just — go. Don't lose it.

Deacon: Jesus — okay, alright. What's going on, O'Brian? Why am I out here in
        the shit chasing choppers down for you?

O'Brian: The destination is classified, I'm locked out of their files — so I
         can't give you the coordinates to their LZ. You have to follow them
         in.

Deacon: Jesus, don't you guys have, uh — spy satellites, shit like that?
O'Brian: Not that I have access to, no. I told you, I'm —
Deacon: — locked out, yeah, I heard you.
O'Brian: Don't lose them.
Deacon: Huh, slowing down. O'Brian. They're landing.

O'Brian: Good. I have their coordinates now via your radio. You better go in
         on foot.

Deacon: On foot.
O'Brian: Remember, you can't let them see you.
Deacon: O'Brian — I'm here. What do you want me to do?

O'Brian: Each of these research units have a science guy like me guarded by a
         bunch of goons. I need you to get close to the researcher. The
         wavelength recorder is set to the channel we use to record data.
         It'll record everything they're doing.

Deacon: Okay, so you want me to sneak into an LZ, filled with heavily armed,
        Kevlar wearing¹ soldiers who shoot on sight, so you can spy on some
        asshole wearing a pocket protector?

O'Brian: Pocket protector? Really? I have a fucking PhD, asshole.
Deacon: Yeah, which stands for piled high and deep.
O'Brian: Do you still have the tracking devices I gave you?

Deacon: Oh, I was gonna sell 'em, but most of us don't have access to shit
        like — you know, satellites.

O'Brian: Place one of them on their helo. Almost all of these filed missions
         include stops that aren't on the books. I want to find out where
         they're going next.

Deacon: O'Brian —

O'Brian: You don't need to ask. I'm already looking into what records we have
         about where evacuees were taken. O'Brian out.

Deacon: This has gotta be it. What the hell are you guys doing out here?

[Deacon sneaks in closer, puts a tracking device on the chopper, then sneaks
 closer to a researcher with a pinned-down Freaker subject.]

Lt. Chavez: Field Note Two Zero Seven One. Checking the traps at site Fourteen
            Alpha have confirmed a large, male subject, with the confirmed
            albinism mutation. Subject has expected lack of skin pigmentation
            and reddish eyes. Muscle mass appears to be forty percent greater
            than normal infected subjects. What was it you called them?
            "Bleachers?" Well, they're real. While this is only the third
            subject we've been able to study — as noted, their strength and
            ability to absorb damage make them extremely dangerous to approach
            — we've noted in other field reports that over a thousand have been
            spotted in this area. Whatever is causing the mutation, it's
            spreading rapidly.

Deacon: What the hell, O'Brian.¹

O'Brian: What's wrong?

Deacon: I'll tell ya what's wrong. Your boys were carving out the guts of a
        Freak while it was still alive.

O'Brian: They're not "my boys." And what do you care? Aren't you a — what do
         you guys like to call yourselves? Drifters? Don't you kill the
         infected for money, or whatever shit you barter with?

Deacon: Yeah, I kill Freaks, but I don't carve them open while they're still
        alive and listen to 'em scream.

O'Brian: Did you get my data?
Deacon: Yeah. I got your data.
O'Brian: Okay, I'm uploading it now. I'll be in touch. O'Brian out.

Deacon: O'Brian? O'Brian? Ah, Goddammit, he did it again. O'Brian? Talk to me —
        Shit. You better be in touch, O'Brian.

[Afterwards, another truther message plays.

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. It's with a
          heavy heart that I report six deaths and two injuries from my camp
          this week. And not from the usual shit — no, it was those damn black
          choppers. Let me tell you, everything I been warning you about¹ it,
          is absolutely comin' true. Heard those choppers touched down and
          wiped out an entire group of men and women who were screamin' and
          beggin' for mercy. Citizens of this country, and they cut 'em down.
          My men returned fire, but — shit. This won't be the last we hear of
          'em, either. They're hunting us down, those of us who dared to
          survive and mess with their plans. They're killin' us off, so they
          can finally emerge from their gopher holes. Stay vigilant, people,
          and keeps your eyes on the sky. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free
          Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

[After hearing how Lisa went missing, Deacon rides to Rogue Camp, an wintry,
 overrun suburb a ways away from Lost Lake.]

Deacon: Okay, this has gotta be it. Lisa? I'm coming for you. She's gotta be
        out here somewhere. Alright, where are you, kid? Ah, Goddammit, you
        gotta be around here somewhere. No, no. Not in here.

[After searching around, Deacon finds a house he can't enter easily.]

Deacon: Now, how the hell am I going to get in? Locked. Nope.

[He pushes a car away from a cracked garage door.]

Deacon: Through here, yeah — this'll do it. Inside here —

[He finds some scribbles on a shelf in a girl's bedroom.]

Deacon: Is this Lisa's handwriting? "I Want to Forget" — that sounds like
        something she would write.

[Deacon returns back to Lost Lake's infirmary to check on Boozer.]

Deacon: Hey, I came by to see how the lazy bastard's doing. How you doin',
        Boozeman? Are you — you tired of layin' around — yet —

[He sees Boozer in a bad way, moaning and groaning.]

Deacon: Boozer? Hey —
Addy: You can't be in here, Deacon. C'mon — Deacon.
Deacon: C'mon, c'mon — hey, what's going on? How's he doing?
Addy: He needs his rest.
Deacon: Don't mess around with me, Addy. I asked you — how is he doin'?
Boozer: I'm good, I'm good.
Addy: Not good.
Boozer: Damn, it's cold —
Deacon: But, the antibiotics —
Addy: They're not enough. They're never enough.
Deacon: No, wait a second, you said that if I —
Addy: I said — that we would try. Look, all we can do is wait.
Deacon: Wait. Okay. Alright.
Boozer: Deek — Deek —
Deacon: No, there's — You know what, there's something I can do about this —
Addy: Deacon — Deacon. Deacon — Deacon, stop. Stop!
Deacon: I can get — What?!

Addy: I know you wanna smash something — I see that look in your eyes. But you
      know what? You go right ahead, but you do it out there —

Deacon: Addy, I can —

Addy: Go. Look — there is nothing else you can do. Please — just go home. Go.
      Home. Deacon.

Boozer: Deek — Deek —

[Addy shuts the door as a delirious Boozer calls out for him. Skizzo nears.]

Skizzo: So, he gonna make it?
Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo, he'll be fine. I just — he needs a few days.
Skizzo: Come with me to the lodge. I wanna show you something.
Deacon: I got shit to do.

Skizzo: I'm stickin' my neck out here. Trust me, you're gonna want to see this.
        Just — just listen. Coupla months back, this Drifter comes into camp,
        tellin' all kind of crazy stories. Said he worked at the airport, was
        on the ground, back in Farewell, when shit went down. One night they
        were expecting a flight in from Portland — only it never shows up. The
        plane? Was doing a haul for the Red Cross.

Deacon: The Red Cross?

Skizzo: Yeah, you getting it? Medicine, doctor shit, cargo hold full of it.
        Maybe even some of those uh, anti-whateverthefucks —

Deacon: Antibiotics.
Skizzo: Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit like that. Just like that.
Deacon: Where?
Skizzo: Hey, keep your voice down¹ willya? Let's talk inside.

[They enter Iron Mike's lodge and walk to a map.]

Skizzo: So this Drifter. He's working in the control tower when the plane
        disappears off the radar — Poof. Now you see it, now you don't. Right
        about — here.

Deacon: South of Mount Washington.

Skizzo: That's what he said. It came down intact. A controlled crash or
        whatever. Guy's got to listen to the pilot bleeding out from a broken
        pelvis on the ground.

Deacon: Okay, so you haven't sent anyone to find this.

Skizzo: Nope.

Deacon: Why not?

Skizzo: 'Cause the old man won't have it.

Deacon: Iron Mike? What the — oh, right. Rippers.

Skizzo: You catch on quick. Everything west of the Iron Ridge here — Belongs
        to Carlos and his merry band a' bald-headed freak-a-likes.

Deacon: Shit.

Skizzo: So, you go over there and get caught? You head north, brother.
        Otherwise, Iron Mike's treaty with Rest in Peace goes — just like that.

Deacon: Okay, yeah, no, yeah — I get it, I get it. Let me ask you a question.
        Why are you tellin' me this?

Skizzo: Oh, wait a minute — first off, I'm not telling you shit. You remember
        that. Second off, you're a Goddamn Drifter. What am I supposed to do,
        follow you around like I'm your little bitch? Keep your ass outta
        trouble?

Deacon: Alright.

Skizzo: I have things to do.

Deacon: I get it. You're just a regular stand-up guy, right¹ Skizzo?

Skizzo: Just tryin' to stay alive, like everybody else. Hey. You do what you
        gotta do. The end a' the day? That's all we got. Do you know what I'm
        saying?

Deacon: I know what you're saying, Skizzo.

Skizzo: Keep your radio close. I'll be in touch.

[Skizzo leaves.]

Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo, we can always count on you. Shit — now what? Anything's
        better than standing around this shithole.

[Later, as Deek rides outside of town:]

Skizzo: Hey, St. John. You there?

Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo. I'm here.

Skizzo: Yeah, that business we were talkin' about? It's gonna take me a bit —
        I gotta go check on security at the border with Iron Butte — check on
        the Rippers there, if you know what I mean.

Deacon: Uh — no, Skizzo, I don't got a clue. Why don't ya spell it out for me?

Skizzo: Nice try, smart ass¹. Remember, I'm goin' out on a limb here. Don't
        make me regret it. Anyway, I'll be in touch real soon. In the meantime,
        make yourself useful around camp. Prove Iron Mike was right for a
        change.

Deacon: Yeah, sure, whatever you say, whatever you say. St. John out.

[Even later still...]

Skizzo: Hey, St. John. Where you at¹ brother?

Deacon: I'm here, Skizzo, but I'm not your Goddamn brother.

Skizzo: Hey, no skin off my nose. Just doin' what I can to help your bro. That
        business we discussed? Let's just say, uh — you should head out that
        way now.

Deacon: Oh, you mean the border with the Rippers.

Skizzo: Very funny. I meant no such thing. Huh — all I said was, if you were
        thinkin' about takin' a ride — what do you Drifters like to call it?
        Ridin' the open road — now would be a good time to do it. You got me?

Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo, like always, I got you. St. John out.

[Deacon heads to the deserted border bridge at Camp Pioneer.]

Deacon: Skizzo, it's St. John. I'm at the border.
Skizzo: You see any of my men around?
Deacon: No, Skizzo, it's clear. Look, how much time do I got?

Skizzo: Time? Time for what? All I know is I got a card game going on with a
        few of my guys — Couple of 'em, maybe they should be out on guard duty,
        but I'm lettin' that slide. If I had to guess, I'd say we'd be playin'
        all night.

Deacon: So until morning. Got it. Deacon out. Yeah, this is it —

[He creeps into Ripper territory and eventually finds the downed plane.]

Deacon: Oh Jesus — hell of a mess —

[From behind some wreckage, a gigantic musclebound Freaker rips another apart.
 This is a new type -- a Breaker -- and it's killed only with much effort.]

Deacon: That it? Jesus H. Christ — One — tough — sonofabitch — Antibiotics.
        Gotta find me some antibiotics — Let's see — Yes — this'll work —
        Gotta get 'em back to my bike.

[Deacon returns to his ride and secures the medical cooler.]

Deacon: These'll fix him up — an' then we ride outta here. Head north, like he
        said.

Rikki: Deacon St. John, you there? Deek, this is Rikki, over.

Deacon: Dammit, I can't let her know I'm out here — Uh, hey, Rikki? This is
        Deek, uh — you're breakin' up, I can't hear ya —

Rikki: Deek, where are you? I need to get —

[He shuts off his radio.]

Deacon: Yeah, sorry¹ Rikki — I don't have time for this right now.

[Deacon returns back to Lost Lake territory in the morning.]

Skizzo: Wait, that's Deacon. Behind him! You, you — ride up the road. Make
        sure they don't come back. Now!

[The flunkies leave.]

Skizzo: You find it?
Deacon: What was left of it, yeah.
Skizzo: What was left of it?
Rikki: Hey, I heard gunshots. What's going on?
Skizzo: We had a run-in with a few Rippers. But I handled it.
Rikki: You handled it? What's that —

[She sees Deacon's new cooler.]

Rikki: Wow. I shoulda known.
Skizzo: You should've known what? Jesus, Rikki — who's runnin' security here?
Rikki: You know, I ask myself that shit every single day.
Skizzo: I'm done here.
Rikki: Good.

[Skizzo walks across the bridge.]

Deacon: So what are you doing out here?
Rikki: What am I doing, Deek? Look, Addy told me to come and get you.

Rikki: I don't know. We gotta go.

[Rikki and Deacon ride back to town.]

Deacon: What's wrong with Boozer?

Rikki: All I know is Addy told me to find you. When I asked around, I found
       out you and Skizzo were heading up here. Now I know why.

Deacon: I don't know what you're talking about.

Rikki: The crash site. The medical supplies. It's no big secret¹ Deek. Iron
       Mike was negotiating with Carlos, making a deal so our camp would split
       it with the Rippers.

Deacon: Oh bullshit.
Rikki: What do you mean?

Deacon: I mean, bullshit. I was there. Half that cargo hold's already been
        looted. Tracks from the crash site all head south. You know, I've been
        dealin' with the fuckin' Rippers for months. You can't trust a Goddamn
        thing they say.

Rikki: Now you're sounding like Skizzo — Skizzo, he put you up to this, he
       told you about the crash site.

Deacon: Ha, yeah, great, so now you're calling me Skizzo's errand boy?
Rikki: No? Then how'd you find out about it?

Deacon: A Drifter, up at Copeland's Camp. Like you said, it ain't no big
        secret.

Rikki: Yeah right. Well, Skizzo's been trying to pick a fight with the Rippers
       for months. Guess it's lucky you came along to do it for him.

[They keep riding.]

Rikki: So let me ask you somethin'.
Deacon: Can I stop you?

Rikki: Last time I saw you, before last winter, you told Iron Mike to go fuck
       himself, because he wouldn't pay you to bring in survivors.

Deacon: That's not exactly what happened.

Rikki: I remember it pretty clearly. Iron Mike said he'd have nothing to do
       with slavers.

Deacon: Okay, we never forced anyone to come in against their will.
Rikki: How about Tucker? Same thing true for her?
Deacon: I don't know.

Rikki: You ever think, when you roll up on someone, starving out in the shit,
       maybe hasn't slept in days — reached the point where they stop running
       from men like you.¹ You ever think — they don't have a choice? But you
       took 'em to the Hot Springs just the same. Earn a few camp credits.
       Everybody's got a choice, Deacon. It takes us a lot too, bringing in
       someone who can't work, can't earn their way. You know, you just be glad
       that Iron Mike isn't like you.

[They return to the infirmary. Boozer is convulsing and hallucinating.]

Addy: William — William, if you can hear me, I need you to stop —
Rikki: Addy, what's going on?
Deacon: Boozer?
Addy: Go and hold him.
Deacon: What the hell are you doing? What are you doin'?
Addy: Listen, listen — we need to do this and we need to do it right now.
Deacon: Need to do what?

[He looks at Boozer ranting and raving.]

Deacon: Oh no — no, no —
Addy: Deacon —
Deacon: No, you're not — no way, no you're not gonna do this to him —

Addy: Deacon, listen to me. The antibiotics will save his life, but nothing on
      God's earth is gonna save the arm. Now listen — I need you to help me
      right now — Or you can just watch your friend die.

Deacon: Alright. Okay.
Rikki: Addy, we're losing him!
Deacon: Alright, alright.
Addy: Deacon —
Deacon: Alright, alright.
Addy: C'mon.

[They go over to Boozer.]

Deacon: Hey, pal. Hey, pal. Alright, hey — I just need you to stay with me.
Addy: Hold him. Hold him there. Hold him.
Deacon: Okay.
Addy: Okay. Hold him down right there.
Deacon: Okay! Okay, okay —

[Addy starts amputating, eliciting screams from Boozer.]

Addy: Okay — uh — Goddammit, we're losing him.

Deacon: No, no, no — he's losing too much blood. You gotta stop, he's losing
        too much blood.

Addy: Hand me the gauze.
Deacon: Alright — Oh, no — Boozer, c'mon¹ man, c'mon.
Addy: Hold him!
Deacon: You're okay¹ pal — where? Where do I hold him?!
Addy: Just hold him right there — stop panicking and hold him, Deacon!
Deacon: Alright I'm trying — I'm trying!

[Eventually, the procedure is a success. Boozer is left to rest.]

Addy: Hey — you did good in there.

Rikki: When I was in high school, I thought — Hmm, maybe I should be a
       mechanical engineer. Or should I be a surgeon? I guess I should've been
       a surgeon. Oh —

Addy: And you —
Deacon: Hey, hey — okay.
Addy: Y'know, you saved your friend's life today.
Deacon: I don't think he's gonna see it that way.

Addy: Yeah, well, I think he will. I gotta go and give him his IV drip. And,
      y'know what, I don't know where you got all this — and I don't want to
      know — But it's gonna save a lot of lives, Deacon St. John. A lot of
      lives.

Rikki: I gotta go help Addy.
Skizzo: Mike — just settle down, okay?
Iron Mike: Deacon! Get out here!

[Deacon walks outside to the furious camp leader.]

Iron Mike: I heard what you did.
Deacon: I wasn't about to let him die.
Skizzo: Mike. Let it go. It's done.
Iron Mike: I know that, Goddammit. Boozer gonna live?
Deacon: I dunno.

Iron Mike: But the Rippers saw you — followed you back. When Carlos finds out
           about this, there's gonna be the devil to pay.

Deacon: Carlos can go fuck himself.

Iron Mike: You are writing checks with other mens'¹ blood. I hope you're good
           with that.

[Mike storms off.]

Skizzo: You did what had to be done. Mike — wait up.

[Later, while Deacon's out riding:]

Rikki: Deacon, you there?
Deacon: Yeah¹ Rikki, what's up?
Rikki: I just wanted to say — I — I'm sorry — about what happened to Boozer.
Deacon: Yeah, probably not as sorry as he is.

Rikki: Look, Addy wanted you to know that if you hadn't brought her that Liston
       knife — Boozer — would be in a hell of a lot more pain right now.

Deacon: Yeah, well, it just made it easier for you to carve him up.
Rikki: Anyway — I — we hope — he makes it. He's my friend too — you know?

Deacon: Hey, listen, um — thanks for bringing us in, Rikki. I — I gotta go.
        Deacon out.

[Later, Deek radios in to town.]

Deacon: Addy, you there? Deacon St. John to Lost Lake Infirmary, come back.

Boozer: Deek. Hey — uh, feelin' a little out of it, ya know? You okay — what's
        going on?

Deacon: Boozer — hey — uh, nothing. I¹ uh — got tired of listening to the Radio
        Free Oregon — can only take so much of his truther bullshit, you know?

Boozer: Deek, uh — Addy told me — how I'd be dead if it weren't for you —
        gettin' the anti-whatever-the-fucks — y'know —

Deacon: Boozer, I¹ uh —

Boozer: Musta been fun — holdin' me down while she fuckin' whacked away at me.
        Remember how, uh — how Jack carved up that turkey, last time we was
        all together? How it kept slippin' all over the Goddamn table?

Deacon: Yeah — Boozeman, I remember.

Boozer: I still feel it — ya know? The knife. Worse than the Rippers. If — if
        you hadn't been there to — to hold me down — I don't know what woulda
        happened — Deek — I don't know —

Deacon: Well it's done, Boozer. It's done — it's over.
Boozer: Deek — sorry, feelin' — feelin' a little woozy —

Deacon: Yeah, uh — hey, Addy's gonna kill me if she finds you're outta bed
        fucking around.

Boozer: Yeah, I — I hear a bunk — callin' my name. Lost Lake signin' off.
Deacon: Listen, Boozer — shit.

[After Boozer's arm fiasco, Deacon goes into the wilds at O'Brian's behest --
 this time, to the old lumber mill.]

Deacon: O'Brian, I'm at one of your beacons.
O'Brian: Which one?
Deacon: What do you mean which one? This — NERO radio has a GPS, doesn't it?

O'Brian: Yes, of course it does. Uh — uh — okay — uh — you're at Olallie Falls
         — okay, good. Keep an eye out. A field op is going to be there any
         minute. O'Brian out.

Deacon: O'Brian — oh, Goddammit. O'Brian, come in. Your friends are here.
        O'Brian?
O'Brian: I told you, they're not my friends. Okay, head in on foot —

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. What do you want me to do? Use one of these
        tracking devices?

O'Brian: No, not this time. I'm already tracking this one. Follow the
         researcher. She's there to investigate an infected subject — a Freak
         — that was tagged in a nearby cave.

Deacon: A cave? You want me to follow armed NERO goons into a cave.

O'Brian: Just, stay close to her. While you're in range, I can intercept her
         data.

Deacon: O'Brian —
O'Brian: I'm still working on the info you want. Don't ask.
Deacon: Then why the hell am I talkin' to you?
O'Brian: O'Brian out.

[Deacon approaches the LZ and tracks the researcher into the cave.]

Deacon: Just stay closer to her — right, O'Brian? Easier said than done.
Cpl. Franklin: Hey¹ doc.
Lt. Booth: Yeah?
Cpl. Franklin: I never got that.
Lt. Booth: Got what?
Cpl. Franklin: The whole Stage One, Stage Two, Stage Three thing.
Lt. Booth: What do you mean?
Cpl. Franklin: I mean, the virus is what it is, right?
Lt. Booth: No. It's more complicated than that. Now let me —

Cpl. Franklin: Okay — I know, I'm a grunt. Before the Freakshow? I was a
               biology major — just gimme the gist.

Lt. Booth: Really?
Cpl. Franklin: Try me.

Lt. Booth: Okay — we don't really know. But blood tests show — the current
           evidence suggests that the virus spreads through the lymph system,
           reproducing and attacking cells on a catastrophic scale —

Cpl. Franklin: Attacking —

Lt. Booth: More precisely, expressing a series of normally dormant
           proto-oncogenes into an active state.

Deacon: Stay with her. What the hell is she doing?
Cpl. Franklin: Cancer.
Lt. Booth: Look at him. Look at all of them. That look like cancer to you?
Cpl. Franklin: Well — maybe a really bad —
Lt. Booth: No, no, no — this is something far worse.
Cpl. Franklin: Whaddya mean?

Lt. Booth: This virus is on a mission. The Freaks are what they are, because
           the virus wants them that way —

Cpl. Franklin: What are you saying?
Lt. Booth: I'm saying — Jesus — what am I saying?
Cpl. Franklin: Terrorism? You're saying this was deliberate?
Lt. Booth: I don't know.

Deacon: Uh — is that it? Is she done? Yeah, okay — time to get the hell outta
        dodge¹.

[Deacon retreats back to his bike.]

Deacon: O'Brian, come in. I've got the data.
O'Brian: Receiving it now. Thank you, Drifter.

Deacon: What the hell is she talkin' about, O'Brian? About this — virus,
        whatever the hell it is, or what — what it's doing — I wanna know what
        the hell's going on, O'Brian. Why are they out here? What the fuck are
        you doing? O'Brian?

O'Brian: Okay, I'll be in touch. O'Brian out.

[While out riding:]

Rikki: Lost Lake to Deacon St. John. Are you there?
Deacon: Uh — yeah¹ Rikki. What's up?

Rikki: Iron Mike says you volunteered to stick around, do some runs for the
       camp. But — that you refuse to work for Skizzo.

Deacon: Yeah — something like that.

Rikki: Well, I can't say I blame you. Okay, well I guess I'm stuck with you.
       So, stop by the mechanic shop — we've got a job for you.

Deacon: Yeah, okay. Deacon out.

[He stops by Rikki's area in town.]

Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki — you said you had a job for me?
Rikki: Hey, Deek. Yeah — you remember Shane Riley? Everyone called him "Red."
Deacon: Red Riley? Yeah — never heard of him. But, let me guess — ginger?

Rikki: What? Red hair? No. It was his boots. He wore these rattlesnake boots
       dyed with god-awful red color. He made quite the impression.

Deacon: No — I bet.

Rikki: Anyway, he used to do runs for us, back in the day, until one day he
       decides he didn't like the camp credits we were paying, so he up and
       kills Lindsey Fuller —

Deacon: Who?
Rikki: Lindsey worked supply before Blair —
Deacon: Wait a second, so he killed an unarmed woman?

Rikki: Oh, she was armed,¹ she just wasn't expecting him to shoot her in the
       face. Will you listen? So Red murders her, cleans out her supply hut,
       and then takes off before anyone knows what's happened. Got away clean —

Deacon: Well — that sonofabitch.
Rikki: — until now. He and his men have been spotted up at Camp Pioneer.
Deacon: You don't gotta ask — I, uh — I got this thing about —
Rikki: About killing unarmed women. I know — so I knew you'd want to handle it.

Deacon: Yeah — like I said, I got this covered. Um — what else can you tell me
        about him?

Rikki: Not much — oh wait — he chews tobacco. I heard he was such an addict
       that he rounds up cigarette butts, takes out the tobacco, and chews
       that.

Deacon: Well that's disgusting. So now I got two reasons to kill him.
Rikki: Yeah, but be careful¹ Deek.

[Deacon goes up to the camp. Gunfire rings out everywhere.]

Deacon: Hey Rikki — I'm at Camp Pioneer and it's — a Goddamn war zone.
Rikki: What's goin' on? Are any of our guys there?

Deacon: Uh — no, I don't think so. Sounds like they're clearing Freaks. Uh —
        don't worry. I'll find this guy. Deacon out. Alright, Red — where the
        hell are ya? Newts — oh, well — they're killing Newts — Okay, what's
        this —

[He inspects local clues.]

Deacon: Okay — yes, yes. Cigarette butts, yes — Bootprints — Uh — that's
        tobacco spit — Red Riley, you are one gross motherfucker. More
        bootprints — yeah, this way — Uh — what's in here — Wooden box — More
        bootprints — Oh good. Urine — Jesus. Well, if ya gotta go, ya gotta go.
        Where the fuck are you hiding, Red¹ — he's gotta be here somewhere —
        Hidin' in one a these shacks? Huh?

[As Deacon nears a shack, he can hear Red jabbering.]

Red Riley: She had it comin' — the one that I shot? She was mouthin' off to
           me, somethin' to see really. She shoulda known, too — I don't take
           shit offa no one — I told her, you shut the hell up or I'm gonna
           shoot you in the face. Did she listen to me? Hell no. No one ever
           fuckin' listens to me. Well, she hears me now. Ain't no one gonna
           disrespect Red Riley and walk away, no sir. Well, I mean she don't
           hear me, does she. She ain't got no Goddamn head left —

Deacon: There he is — Come on, Red — come on out —

[Once Red appears, he'll say various lines if left alive long enough.]

Red Riley: I don't wanna have to kill you Drifter, but I will — Whatcha doin'
           out here, Drifter? You come all the way out here to die? This here
           used to be a scoutin' camp — you don't wanna be killin' a man out
           here, do ya? Desecratin' it and all? Jesus, Drifter — is this all
           about that bitch got herself killed back at Iron Mike's? Wasn't me,
           I swear. An' if it was me, she had it comin' — you know the type,
           same as me — mouthy little bitch, you know?

[When Red's killed and his boots taken as trophies, Deek returns to Rikki.]

Deacon: Hey — hey¹ Rikki — I got him.

Rikki: Deacon — what a relief. Lindsey has some folks she was close to — I'll
       let 'em know.

Deacon: Yeah, okay — I'll — see ya around, Rikki.

[Iron Mike radios in later.]

Iron Mike: Deacon St. John. This is Lost Lake, come in.
Deacon: Yeah, Mike. This is Deek —

Iron Mike: Heard ya brought in Shane Riley, but when I went to the shack to
           question him, he wasn't there.

Deacon: Uh — yeah, uh — about that Mike — I tried to bring him in, I really
        did — but he¹ uh — well, he put up a helluva fight. So he didn't leave
        me much choice, Mike. He didn't.

Iron Mike: Uh-huh. You remember what I said — about how we do things around
           here.

Deacon: Yeah — yeah, Mike. I remember.
Iron Mike: Lost Lake out.
Deacon: Thanks¹ Rikki.

[Deacon returns to Lost Lake to speak with Mike.]

Iron Mike: Deek.

Deacon: I've been, uh — thinkin' about what you were saying, about — Doing
        something to make a difference around here. Pay back the camp.

Iron Mike: I'm listenin'
Deacon: Do you got a few minutes? I wanna show you somethin'.
Iron Mike: Yeah, guess I could spare you a minute or two. So where we headin'?
Deacon: You ever been up to the caves, north of the lake?
Iron Mike: I know 'em. Come on, see if you can keep up.
Deacon: Okay — let's go.

Iron Mike: I got marsh duty anyway this morning,¹ gotta see if any Freaks are
           stuck in the muck out that way —

Deacon: When's the last time you went up there?

Iron Mike: Been a few years, I guess. When I was a boy, I used to live in that
           damn cave,¹ my old man sorta fancied himself a geologist. Sounds
           like we got a couple — Freaks stuck in the mud, I mean.

Deacon: Yeah — sounds like — here, let me take care of 'em.
Iron Mike: Alright, I guess I can let you do that —

[Deacon executes the swamped Freakers.]

Iron Mike: Nice work. I think Skizzo's just found a new man for the job —
Deacon: You know what Skizzo can go do —

Iron Mike: Anyway, as I was sayin' — He'd spend hours talkin' about how all
           these caves were formed when — lava flows would harden on the
           outside, but the molten cores would still flow like buried rivers.
           You got the big caves that drew in the tourists, like Metolius up
           there, and there's way more than that, riddled all over these parts.

Deacon: Okay, okay, we're coming up on the highway, we gotta be quiet —

[They spy on a horde shambling up the road.]

Deacon: Alright — get down, get down.

Iron Mike: Jesus Christ. This is why you brought me out here? To smell a buncha
           Goddamn Freaks?

Deacon: Yeah. Okay, okay. C'mon. Follow 'em.
Iron Mike: Wait, wait, wait, follow 'em. Where the hell are we goin'?
Deacon: You'll see. C'mon. Now don't get too close — Stay down —

Iron Mike: Just what the hell are we doin', Deek? This doesn't seem all that
           smart, even for a Goddamn Drifter.

Deacon: Hold up, hold up, you remember telling me about how the tourists used
        to floow up from California in the summer, choke off Highway 97 and
        the I-5 freeway?

Iron Mike: Yeah. In July, folks smelled almost as bad as these here Freaks.

Deacon: Well, you weren't wrong about one thing — these Freaks — the big groups
        — the ones that some call Hordes — I think they're the reason we can't
        get their numbers down.

Iron Mike: What do you mean?

Deacon: Think about it¹ man. I've been out here in the shit collecting bounties
        for more than a year, Boozer too. Rikki, an' Skizzo, a few others. How
        many Freaks you think I killed?

Iron Mike: A few.
Deacon: A few — yeah, but their numbers never go down.
Iron Mike: You got a point?

Deacon: It's these Hordes. Every night, there's a steady stream of 'em, up and
        down the Santiam Highway, thousands of Freaks, pouring into the Lost
        Lake valley, north of the Cascades.

Iron Mike: And you think they're coming up from California? Highway's closed
           off, no one's been south of the Santiam Pass in years —

Deacon: It's not closed off to the Hordes. Freaks are the reason it's closed
        off. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that the Hordes come in,
        every night, not a Goddamn thing we can do to stop 'em.

Iron Mike: Well, you got that much right. Lost more than a few men trying to,
           back in the day.

Deacon: Yeah, I know, I was there. And every Horde that comes through leaves
        a few stragglers, or — gets busted up and scatters — and just like
        that — Freaks everywhere, as far as the eye can see.

Iron Mike: Ya don't — ya don't need to see them to know that they're around.

Deacon: We figure out a way to stop the Hordes' comin' through, maybe we can
        make some headway, reduce their numbers.

Iron Mike: Make it safer. Free up more farm land, irrigation.
Deacon: Yeah.

Iron Mike: Okay, so how do we do that? You know Goddamn well you can't take on
           a, a — whatever you call it — a Horde.

Deacon: This is how.

[The two watch the horde, hundreds strong, pour into the Metolius cave.]

Iron Mike: I'll be Goddamned.

Deacon: Yep. They stay in there all day, hibernating or whatever the hell
        Freaks do.

Iron Mike: So what're you thinkin', that we —

Deacon: Yep. We blow it the hell up. Stick of dynamite there, there, and there
        — we bring down a mountain of rock, we seal this shit up.

Iron Mike: Yeah, so we trap a few hundred inside, what good is that gonna do?

Deacon: No no no, you don't get it. We seal this cave, maybe they don't got no
        place to sleep. Or maybe this trail of piss and shit dries out — goes
        stale — and others stop comin'.

Iron Mike: Yeah. Alright. Alright — you got my attention. Okay, c'mon — let's
           head back. Alright, my knees are warmed up a bit. Let's see if you
           can keep up.

Deacon: Yeah — okay —

Iron Mike: Tell me. When does bein' out in the shit make you an expert on
           Freaks. You spend your spare time just followin' 'em around? Seeing
           what makes 'em tick?

Deacon: Not exactly.

Iron Mike: Then how do you know about all this? About what a Horde's gonna do?
           Where they sleep?

Deacon: Few days ago, I was riding north of Belknap Crater, when a chopper flew
        by —

Iron Mike: A chopper. What the hell?

Deacon: Just listen to me. It was a black chopper — one of those NERO choppers
        that used to fly all over the Goddamn place, when the shit was going
        down.

Iron Mike: And you saw one — still flying.

Deacon: I followed them, I stole one of their radios. I've been tryin' to track
        'em down, see if they have a base around here, supplies. Shit, I mean,
        to see if the Feds are still alive, you know what I'm sayin'? They're
        out here doing field work of some kind, on Freaks, they're studying
        'em.

Iron Mike: They got resources to do that, while we're out here starving,
           fighting to stay alive.

Deacon: I followed 'em up to the Grotto Caves, you know the ones?
Iron Mike: Yeah.

Deacon: They had motion sensors set up, measuring how many Freaks used the cave
        during the day, and uh — Mike, it was thousands.

Iron Mike: That right.

Deacon: They said Freaks all up and down the Cascade range, south of Crater
        Lake, and north up to Smith Rock, all use these lava tube caves to
        hibernate. So we blow up these caves? Maybe we have a few less to deal
        with.

Iron Mike: Hey — this idea of yours — it's got some merit. But — Job like that,
           it's gonna take a fair amount a' TNT.

Deacon: You said you wanted help making Lost Lake safer? This is how we do it.

Iron Mike: Alright. Alright, look. There's some things I gotta do. Okay? But
           you meet me at the bridge in a couple of minutes. I know where we
           can find some.

[After Mike leaves, Skizzo radios in.]

Skizzo: St. John — you were supposed to be up at the farm an hour ago. My guy
        said he's got a shovel waitin' for you.

Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo — about that — I'm busy. See, Iron Mike and I were just
        heading out on a run —

Skizzo: You and Iron Mike? You'll get your ass up that way today or you and
        your gimp boyfriend are gonna find yourselves out in the shit, you hear
        me? Without a Goddamn paddle.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah — I'll get right on that. St. John out.

[Deacon meets up with Mike later on.]

Iron Mike: You ready?
Deacon: Where're we headed?
Iron Mike: This time you're gonna have to trust me.
Deacon: Okay. Where are we goin'?
Iron Mike: You know what they used to mine, all 'round these parts?
Deacon: Yeah, uh — mercury, or something.

Iron Mike: That's right. Cinnabar, they extracted mercury from cinnabar. Folks
           back east think it was gold mines our here, and silver — but not so.
           Back in the early 1900s, cinnabar was worth more than gold. To
           operate the mine, you need TNT, for expansions, blowin' out new
           tunnels, clearin' cave ins¹, that sorta shit. And to own TNT, you
           had to register with the county, keep copies of the keys to all
           your lock boxes¹ with the commissioner.

Deacon: Wait — the County Courthouse. Where the hell is that?
Iron Mike: I thought you knew — it's in the old Federal Building.

Deacon: The old Federal Building? The one in Sherman's Camp? Jesus¹ Mike. What
        the hell? You told me — you told me that you were never settin' foot in
        that place again.

Iron Mike: Did I? I don't recall.
Deacon: You were drunk. Right after Joe was killed.
Iron Mike: Did I tell ya why?
Deacon: No.
Iron Mike: Here. Turn right here. This is it.

[They disembark.]

Deacon: Mike, the place is gonna be crawlin'. I don't — I don't think this is
        a good idea.

Iron Mike: Ahh — Weather holds, we'll be safe enough. Alright. That there? It's
           the old Federal Building. That's where we're headed.

Deacon: Let's not go lookin' for trouble. Stay outta the buildings.
Iron Mike: C'mon, we gotta head over this way.
Deacon: Where are we headed?
Iron Mike: Just follow me. Key'll be on the commissioner.
Deacon: And — and you know where he is? Where his — body is?
Iron Mike: Yeah, I think I do. You heard what happened here?

Deacon: Yeah. Everybody got wiped out, man, woman and child. Only a few got
        out, and, uh — you were one of them, right?

Iron Mike: Only two got out. Me and Nora. But it wasn't the Freaks that took
           us out.

Deacon: What do you mean?
Iron Mike: Here.

[They stop in front of a locked-up preschool. Mike unlocks the front entrance,
 revealing a grisly bloodbath inside.]

Deacon: Oh my God — what the hell, Mike?

Iron Mike: Two weeks in, the ammo was gone. Two sides called a truce — a
           meeting. Right here. Oh, we knew what was coming. We knew what was
           coming and we were prepared. Fight — didn't last long, but — But it
           was bad. They had ammunition left after all and — hell, they — Oh
           hell, you can see what they did. Like I said. Two people walked out
           of this town, after all was said and done. And some days? I wish to
           hell one of 'em wasn't me. Commissioner's over there in the bean
           counter suit. Go get the key so we can get the hell outta here.

Deacon: You didn't give a damn about sealing the caves. You brought me here —
        you brought me here because you wanted me to see this.

Iron Mike: Not true. Alright, you got the key? We're gonna go get the maps to
           those mines, just like I said, and we're gonna get more'n enough
           TNT to seal every cave in the valley.

Deacon: Bullshit.
Iron Mike: You are right about one thing — I'm not sorry you've seen it.
Deacon: Not followin' you, Mike.

Iron Mike: I am talking about the war that's coming! With the Rippers — the one
           that Skizzo's so hot for — you think he cares how many die? On
           either side? Nevermind. C'mon, let's get this done.

[They get the key and walk nearby to the courthouse.]

Deacon: Here's the door —
Iron Mike: Place is locked up tight — C'mon — gotta find a way upstairs.
Deacon: Smells like something died in here —

Iron Mike: Newts — yeah, I smell 'em. Bad business. Never much liked kids —
           they always tended to get on my nerves. Was always a sore spot
           between me and my Elizabeth, God rest her soul.

Deacon: You didn't like kids. Wow, here I thought you liked everyone —

Iron Mike: Almost no one, point of fact — but I tolerate most, even smartass
           Drifters — C'mon —

[They root around in the commissioner's office and get the maps.]

Iron Mike: Okay — alright. This is it. Now we got maps to every mine in the
           county, showin' where they stored their dynamite. Okay, c'mon.

[They hear motorcycle engines outside.]

Deacon: Hear that?
Iron Mike: Yeah.
Deacon: Well, you expecting anyone?
Iron Mike: Nope.
Deacon: Do you have my back here?

Iron Mike: Hey, I don't like starting trouble but — I'll finish it if I have
           to.

Deacon: Stay behind me —
Iron Mike: Hey, I can take care of myself —

Deacon: I'm not saying you can't — but remember the last time that we were out
        in the shit?

Iron Mike: Yeah, like I said, I'm staying behind you —
Marauder: Spread out, find 'em.

[They kill the marauders inside the courthouse.]

Deacon: That's all of 'em — let's go —
Iron Mike: Right behind ya —

[They get to street level and hear more gunshots as marauders fight Freakers.]

Deacon: Stay down!
Iron Mike: I got this —

Deacon: Freaks. They're bringing the whole Goddamn town down on us — That's
        right¹ boys — keep 'em busy —

Iron Mike: They're doing all the hard work for us —
Deacon: You keepin' up, old man?
Iron Mike: Oh yeah — I'm right behind you —
Deacon: There's the bikes — c'mon.
Iron Mike: I see 'em.
Deacon: Jesus — what a mess.
Iron Mike: Now ya know why no one goes into Sherman's Camp.

Deacon: Addy finds out you're out here risking your ass like this — she's going
        to be pissed.

Iron Mike: Now, how would she find out about something like that?
Deacon: Not from me.

[They fight their way to the gas station, take out a sniper, and mount up,
 leaving the marauders to fight off the endless Freakers deeper in town.]

Deacon: So about the Rippers — why you wanted me to see that shit —
Iron Mike: Y'know¹ Deek, I always saw a bit of myself in you, back in the day.
Deacon: How's that.¹

Iron Mike: You don't give a shit. Oh, you care about your friend, don't wanna
           see him die. But me? Any other Goddamn person on the planet? I don't
           think so.

Deacon: Caring'll just get you killed.

Iron Mike: Yeah, that's right. The thing is? Not caring will get you killed
           just as easily. What the good folks of Sherman Camp did, was stop
           caring about anyone but themselves and their own. Easy to kill a
           man, when he's just some piece of meat standin' between you and what
           you need. Skizzo wants to kill Rippers, 'cause he don't think
           they're human anymore. They don't count. They're "standin' in the
           way of what he wants." Well, I don't buy into that shit. I won't
           have it.

[They finally make it to Lost Lake.]

Iron Mike: Y'know, Skizzo, he, uh — he wonders why I'm a "pacifist." That's,
           y'know, that's what he likes to call me. He uh — He thinks I'm
           gonna get everybody killed.

Deacon: Well are you, Mike? Are you gonna get everyone killed?

Iron Mike: Freaks aren't gonna be around forever. Now when they're gone, we're
           gonna need some folks around here to help pick up the pieces. Hey —
           look, hey, hey. I don't like Carlos and his Rippers, any more than
           I like Tucker or, or, or — Copeland and his — his — his Goddamn
           truthers. Alright? But here — look. Here's the thing, Deek. I'm not
           going outta my way — to kill any of 'em. I've had my share of
           killing.

Deacon: Even if Carlos comes for you?
Iron Mike: My truce'll hold — you can bet on that.

[Mike leaves.]

Deacon: No — Mike — I ain't gonna bet on that. Your truce ain't gonna hold.
        Yeah for once — I agree with Skizzo. The Rippers? They ain't human,
        not anymore.

Russell: Captain Kouri — get Captain Kouri — just — just radio him, dammit —
         the outpost is under attack —

Mullins: Corporal, we gotta move out — we gotta move out — Corporal, more are
         comin' — Corporal —

Deacon: Militia? What the hell?

[Putting the random radio snippet aside, he continues to the site.]

Deacon: O'Brian, I'm at one of your beacons, the one outside of Rogue Camp.
O'Brian: Drifter — uh — St. John, I mean. Uh — copy that.
Deacon: Why am I here?
O'Brian: I show — a helo incoming to that location now. Be ready. O'Brian out.
Deacon: Uh — that's why I'm here.

[Sure enough, a black chopper soon appears.]

O'Brian: St. John, they should have arrived at your location. Do you see them?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah kinda hard to miss. What do you need me to do?

O'Brian: Get close to the researcher — remember, you have to stay in their
         proximity or I can't intercept their data.

Deacon: Okay, yeah, I get it.

O'Brian: And this time, I need you to plant one of those trackers on their
         helo — their chopper.

Deacon: I know what a helo is, O'Brian. And you better have somethin' for me —

O'Brian: I got someone I trust working on it — we'll know soon enough. Okay,
         we're ready to upload the data as soon as you're close. O'Brian out.

Deacon: So what the hell are you boys doing here, huh? Figured you'd stop and
        fill up at the ol' Peltro gas station? In case ya didn't see it, sign
        says "gas low" — But no — I'm guessing you guys don't got that problem
        — do ya?

[Deacon infiltrates the defunct gas station and affixes a tracker.]

Deacon: Okay — I gotta place a tracker on that chopper — Come² guys — just
        gotta clear out — Can't let 'em see me — Got it — Okay, the tracker's
        set. You should be getting telemetry —

O'Brian: Copy that — hold — yes. We're reading it loud and clear. O'Brian out.
Deacon: Yeah, you're welcome¹ O'Brian.

[Deacon climbs onto the gas station roof and eavesdrops on the researcher.]

Deacon: Here he is — she is —

Lt. Booth: Field Note Two Zero Six Zero — We've now completed the survey of
           twenty-four nesting sites, including those at Marion Forks, the
           Pioneer Cemetery, the Cascade Highway lumber site, the truck stop
           on the Old Belknap Road — what was that called again?

Cpl. Franklin: Ah, Crazy Willie's —

Lt. Booth: Yes, very rustic and touristy — some things about the old world I
           don't miss — Crazy Willie's, south of the Belknap Crater.

Cpl. Franklin: I got a question¹ doc.
Lt. Booth: Sure, it's not like I'm busy or anything.
Cpl. Franklin: The nests — why do they build 'em?
Lt. Booth: We don't know.

Cpl. Franklin: Why do they only build them in, you know, buildings, structures,
               cabins — things like that?

Lt. Booth: We have a theory that —

Cpl. Franklin: I mean, we never see 'em where wild animals build them, in
               trees, or out in the wilderness. Only houses.

Lt. Booth: — you finished?
Cpl. Franklin: Sorry.

Lt. Booth: The guys back at the lab have a theory. I'm sure when they're ready
           to talk about it, they'll come rushing down to the barracks to let
           you know.

Cpl. Franklin: Jesus — just asking. I see things too, you know. I wasn't always
               a grunt¹ you know.

Lt. Booth: Can I continue?
Cpl. Franklin: Sure.

Lt. Booth: — south of Belknap Crater. Some areas of the Belknap Wilderness
           were not surveyed due to the proximity of nesting sites to human
           encampments — in particular a large camp at —

Cpl. Franklin: Salome Hot Springs —

Lt. Booth: Ah yes — "Salome." "On Herod's birthday, she danced before them,
           whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she
           would ask. She said: give me the head of John the Baptist. And the
           king was struck sad." Quite the name for a resort.

Cpl. Franklin: No shit.
Lt. Booth: Again, some things about the old world — I don't miss.

Deacon: Upload complete? Yeah. The Bible? Now they're reciting Bible verses.
        Must be nice — flying all over hell and gone — and finding time to
        read — Jesus, O'Brian — Done. Okay, now I just gotta get the hell outta
        here before one of 'em spots me.

[Deacon returns to his bike as the NERO chopper retreats.]

Deacon: O'Brian — O'Brian, are you there?
O'Brian: I can't — talk right now. I'll be on this channel later. Out.

Rikki: That guy we've been looking for — Eric Lynch — who, who murdered
       Campbell and Reed — at the farm —

Deacon: The Lynchman — Sonofabitch. You know where he is?

Rikki: Yes, uh — yeah, he's on the north shore, at the old boat launch. Skizzo
       wanted to go after him, but Iron Mike said to get you.

Deacon: I'll get to him —
Rikki: Thanks¹ Deek — hurry.

[Deek goes out toward the pier.]

Rikki: Deek — we need him alive.
Deacon: Alive? Oh, come on, no — why?
Rikki: Before he ran, he stole two bags of seed — Deek — we need those seeds.
Deacon: Ah, shit —
Rikki: We need to know where he sold them, or stashed them —

Deacon: You're makin' my day a lot more complicated, but — okay, fine — I'll

Deacon: Oh, shit — there he is. Dammit¹ Lynchman — come on! No, no, no — you're

 • You're not taking me alive — you hear me, St. John?
 • Tell Rikki and all of 'em to go to hell! You got that, St. John?

Deacon: You can't get away from me!
Lynchman: Fuck you, man! You hear me?

Deacon: How's it goin'¹ Lynchman? What, is the camp not feeding you well
        enough?

Lynchman: Fuck you.

Deacon: Thought you'd just kill a couple guys, ride off with our shit? Don't
        matter if a buncha folks here die of starvation, because you got what
        you need, right?

Lynchman: Get offa me, you sonofabitch —

Deacon: Hey, hey, hey — hey, listen to me. Rikki's gonna send some men for you
        — you tell 'em where you stashed the seeds, maybe they'll just shoot
        ya — you know, instead of hangin' you slow. What do you think about
        that?

Lynchman: I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.

Deacon: Okay¹ man, suit yourself. Hey, Rikki, I got him. And I'll, uh — send
        you his position. Send someone out here to pick him up.

Rikki: Does he have the seeds on his bike?
Deacon: No, no — I didn't see 'em.
Rikki: Alright, we'll bring him in. Lost Lake out.
Deacon: See you, Lynchman.

[Deacon starts back to Lost Lake.]

Boozer: Deek, you there? I got outta the infirmary today, man. Addy said she'd

Deacon: Sounds like Addy. How's the arm?

        there. No, seriously though? It's like I can still feel my right hand,

Rikki: You comin'?
Deacon: Where?
Rikki: Does it matter?
Deacon: Seriously, where're we headed?
Rikki: North.
Deacon: Rikki, I don't have time for your crap any more than Skizzo's —
Rikki: Come on, I'll show you. Mike told me what you did.
Deacon: I didn't do anything.
Rikki: About how if we seal the caves here, we can stop the Hordes?

Deacon: Never said it would stop them. Maybe slow 'em down. Look, are you going
        somewhere with this?

Rikki: Yeah. I just thought that, maybe you decided to stay. I mean, not just
       because of Boozer — but because you wanted to help.

Deacon: Is that what you thought.¹ Hey, back in the day, I did my share of
        runs.

Rikki: You did — but never anything more than that. And you know it. So now
       you're helping Iron Mike seal the caves? What did you want me to think?

[She stops near the infirmary's generator.]

Rikki: Here. So, a few weeks back, we lost a man when this went down — Shutting
       down the infirmary's respirator.

Deacon: Respirator — oh God, Rikki, look around. If you're on a respirator out
        here, you're already dead.

Rikki: What if it'd been Boozer?

[Deacon doesn't answer.]

Rikki: Yeah, that's what I thought. See, we haven't had power for almost two
       years, but — The transformers and the lines, they all check out. Well,
       at least they do here. I wanna ride up north — check out the hydro dam
       — just to see why it shut down.

Deacon: No, no, riding escort — that's Skizzo's job.

Rikki: I don't need an escort. You lived up there. You know the area better
       than anyone. Deacon, you asked for my help, right? Now I'm asking for
       yours.

Deacon: Shit.

Rikki: Okay, good. I'm gonna go grab some of the guys that can ride —

Deacon: Nope. No you're not. No, we're going in quiet. If we run into
        Copeland's men I can handle them, but the wilderness up there is
        crawling with — Rippers — and scumbags and God knows what else. More
        men? You know what that means? That means more attention.

Rikki: Yeah, but — Deek —
Deacon: No. Uh-huh. No. We're doing this my way.
Rikki: Shit. Fine. Okay. Let's go.
Deacon: Look, Rikki — I gotta ask you, the other night — in the infirmary —
Rikki: — would I have shot you in the face? No.
Deacon: Really? Oh! From the look on your face you —
Rikki: — I would have taken you outside first, and then shot you in the face.

Deacon: — okay, so you wouldn't, you know, want to get blood all over the
        infirmary.

Rikki: Uh-huh, exactly.

[They mount up and leave Lost Lake.]

Rikki: If we get an early start, we can get back before dark.
Deacon: As long as nothin' goes wrong.
Rikki: Oh, what can go wrong? Following you.

Deacon: Just follow the route that I marked on your map. There's some Marauder
        camps up there we wanna stay away from.

Rikki: Yeah — got it.
Deacon: So how did you end up out here? I never asked you.

Rikki: Same as everyone, I guess. When shit went down, I was a hundred miles
       from home,¹ time I got back, everyone was gone.

Deacon: Where are you from?

Rikki: Grew up in a little town outside of Portland. Would work in the city,
       couch surf, go home on weekends.

Deacon: The big city.
Rikki: Yeah right — only in Oregon.

Deacon: What was it like over there? I mean how did you, uh — how did you get
        out?

Rikki: I don't know. Luck I guess? Roads were backed up all the way down the
       coast, one giant parking lot. Willamette Valley was a war zone.
       Everything happened so fast. I — I told my friends to get out when I
       left. I don't think they listened to me.

Deacon: I, uh — I heard they nuked it?

Rikki: Portland? Yeah, I — I heard that too. Don't think it's true. We'd be
       feeling the fallout, right?

Deacon: Yeah. So uh — you and Addy —
Rikki: You got a problem?

Deacon: Me? No, c'mon. I just — I didn't know. You rode with us a long time,
        I guess it, uh — I guess it never came up.

Rikki: I was like you — seemed like — I don't know, keeping your distance was
       just a good way to stay alive.

Deacon: Ok¹, look — I shouldn't have asked. None of my business.

Rikki: That's why I'm at the camp. You know — chance to live a normal life
       again.

Deacon: Good luck with that.
Rikki: It's nothing serious — me and Addy.
Deacon: Didn't look that way to me.
Rikki: Yeah well, things happen fast these days. You know what I mean?
Deacon: Didn't ask. I wanted to tell you something.
Rikki: Shoot.

Deacon: I, uh — look, I appreciate you going to bat for me, for me and Boozer.
        With Iron Mike I mean.

Rikki: Wow, you are gettin' soft.
Deacon: Fuck off.
Rikki: You've never thanked me for anything.
Deacon: Yeah, well, maybe I never had any reason to.
Rikki: Okay. So where'd you and Iron Mike go the other day?
Deacon: Wait, you said that he already told you about it.

Rikki: He was pretty tight-lipped. I've known Iron Mike a long time, and to be
       honest, I — I don't think I've ever seen him so — I don't know —
       depressed. Where'd you go?

Deacon: Sherman's Camp.

Rikki: I heard that place was a Freakshow.

Deacon: It is. But we didn't have much of a choice. I¹ uh — I had an idea about
        sealing the caves, keep the Hordes from coming through. He knew where
        the mining claims office was. We picked up some maps. He's gonna track
        down some explosives.

Rikki: Your radio must be broken. Almost sounded like you volunteered for some
       shit.

Deacon: I'm riding with you now¹ aren't I? Jesus.
Rikki: You just wanted out of marsh duty.
Deacon: Okay. You got me.
Rikki: So what happened? Something happened.
Deacon: Nothing, Rikki. Nothing happened.
Rikki: He didn't say anything?

Deacon: Just — no. No. Nothing happened. And no, Iron Mike didn't say anything.
        Like you said, he's a pretty tight-lipped guy.

[Eventually, the pair comes to the hydroelectric dam in Cascade territory.]

Deacon: Alright, dam's coming up. Take it slow near the gate. No idea who or
        what may be living there.

Rikki: Got it.
Deacon: Well, it looks clear.
Rikki: What, are you expecting trouble?
Deacon: Yeah, always. And if we run into any, we're gone.
Rikki: Alright, come on. I wanna check the outflow.
Deacon: Where are you going?
Rikki: Down here.

[They walk down to the outflow and see the stream is barely moving.]

Rikki: Oh no, no, no. Hey this isn't right. There should be more water flowing
       out. Right there.

Deacon: Yeah?
Rikki: Yeah. And you hear that?
Deacon: What — what?

Rikki: Exactly. If the turbines were running, you'd be able to hear the hum of
       the lines from here.

[She looks up at a broken bridge.]

Rikki: Oh, what happened there?

Deacon: What? Oh, same thing that happened to all the bridges. Smart men in
        uniforms decided blowing 'em up would keep the Hordes from coming in.

Rikki: Hordes of refugees or Hordes of Freaks?
Deacon: Well you figure men like Copeland? Probably both.
Rikki: Alright, c'mon, I wanna check something out.

[They walk to the center of the outdoor complex. Rikki leans against a door.]

Rikki: C'mere, touch this. C'mon.
Deacon: Whaddya —
Rikki: 'Kay. You feel anything?
Deacon: No.

Rikki: Exactly. If more water was flowing, the turbines would be vibrating.
       C'mon. Up this way. We're going all the way up to the top, up there.

Deacon: Following you.

Rikki: See these pipes? They're called the penstock. Water pressure builds up
       from the reservoir and is pushed down through those pipes, concentrating
       the force of the flow, which goes right through to the turbines.

Deacon: How the hell do you know all this stuff?

Rikki: I had two older brothers who were always fixing cars and shit, with my
       dad. He got me a job at Boeing when I was only seventeen. I was going
       to school part time, to become a mechanical engineer, when shit went
       down.

Deacon: You ever see 'em again? Your dad, brothers?
Rikki: No. C'mon. Over here.

[They climb to the top and look out over the dam reservoir.]

Rikki: Alright. Well, let's figure this out. Well, this is gonna be fun.
Deacon: So now what — hold —

[He sees she's stripping.]

Deacon: Wait, what's — what's going on, what're you doin'?

Rikki: We only rode together a few months but in all that time, I never saw
       you volunteer for anything. One of us has to jump down there and clear
       the intake. So — I'm up. Oh but you can stand and — watch. Okay. Well,
       it's now or never. Let's go.

[She jumps in.]

Rikki: Yeah, it's — it's pretty mucked up. I think I can clear it though. Run
       back down to the turbine. See if it's vibrating at all.

[He does.]

Deacon: Hmmm, nothing. Wait a second — there it is. Yep, that did it.

[By the time he climbs back up, Rikki's already up and changed.]

Rikki: Ha, ha, ha! You feel that vibration?
Deacon: Yeah, but the power lines are still dead.

Rikki: What? Man, well it couldn't be that easy, right? Alright, c'mon — let's
       check out the transformers.

Deacon: So, uh — your dad and your brothers, what happened to 'em?

Rikki: I don't know. On my way back, I tried calling over and over — always
       got a busy signal — By the time I reached the house, it was deserted.
       The entire neighborhood was deserted. There were flyers everywhere,
       evacuation orders. I went to the closest refugee camp but — it was
       overrun. Everyone was dead. Freaks were everywhere.

Deacon: Jesus, Rikki. I'm real sorry.
Rikki: Yeah, it was a long time ago.

[They walk over to some machinery.]

Rikki: Hm, these are the ones feeding the lines going south.
Deacon: Alright, any idea what's wrong with 'em? —

Rikki: No, not a clue. Okay. Well, it might be a short in the turbine junction
       boxes. So let's just go down and check it out. Okay?

Deacon: Oh, alright. So, uh — what's with you and Skizzo? I mean it seems like
        you're always on the verge of ripping his throat out.

Rikki: A few months back, Addy and I caught him hiding outside our cabin while
       we were — bathing.

Deacon: What? Oh God, he's a peeping Tom?

Rikki: I told him if it happened again, he'd find out that my gun is bigger
       than his.

Deacon: Jesus. You know, if Addy was there — Skizzo probably wasn't looking at
        you.

Rikki: Ha, it was all I could do to stop her from neutering the bastard.
Deacon: Ouch.
Rikki: Right? Never piss off a woman who knows how to use a scalpel.

[They reach a locked gate.]

Rikki: Here, boost me up.
Deacon: Okay — okay, got it.

Rikki: There. Here, I got the gate. Come on. Junction room's right around here
       — Oh God — what is that smell?

Deacon: Freaker nests. From the smell of it, more than a couple. Stay close.
        How many Molotovs you got with you?

Rikki: Enough.
Deacon: Okay — remember the drill? You light 'em up, I knock 'em down.
Rikki: God, it's been awhile, but I remember.
Deacon: Time to burn — Here they come!
Rikki: Ready —

[They destroy a nest and its inhabitants.]

Rikki: It's over —
Deacon: Burn it down — You ready?
Rikki: Oh yeah.

[They destroy the final nest.]

Deacon: You good?
Rikki: Yeah. They really don't like visitors much, do they?
Deacon: Well, can you blame 'em?

Rikki: Well, they better get used to this shit. Y'know, as of today, I'm
       claiming this for Lost Lake Camp.

Deacon: Power to the people.

Rikki: Alright. Let's check the junction boxes and get the hell outta here.
       This is it. You ready?

Deacon: Yep.

Rikki: Okay — Down.

[The lever switches on the lights.]

Rikki: Yes! Houston, we have power.

Deacon: Nice work.

Rikki: I couldn't have done it without you.

Deacon: Come on. Let's find something to block the door with. I don't wanna
        have to come back up here every month to clean this shit out.

Rikki: Wait, wait, wait — you're gonna be here in a month?

Deacon: What? No. I — I don't know. Would you just — Jesus Christ.
Rikki: I'm just fuckin' with ya¹ Deek. C'mon. So why'd you ask about my dad
       and my brothers?

Deacon: Uh — I don't know. You just, um — you never mentioned 'em before. So
        I'm — you know I'm sorry if I — if it's something you didn't want to
        talk about.

Rikki: No it's fine. In fact, it reminded me of something I wanted to ask you —
       back when we were riding together —

Deacon: Okay, Rikki — Rikki — not now — you can ask me later.

Rikki: What¹ no — hey — hey —

Deacon: Come on — we gotta get moving —

[They walk back outside.]

Rikki: Hey, you never asked — uh — why I stopped riding with you and Boozer.

Deacon: Was I supposed to ask? I already knew why. Iron Mike's bullshit. God —
        Rikki. Do we gotta do this now?

Rikki: We had been riding together for I — I don't remember, a couple months —

[He interrupts with fake laughter.]

Deacon: Where is this — okay.

Rikki: Deek, c'mon. Okay. There was this one night, and I remember it really
       clearly. It was snowing outside and — Boozer was snoring. You remember
       how he used to snore? I swear, I thought — he was gonna bring a Horde
       down on us, right?

Deacon: Yeah, well, that — pretty much hasn't changed.

Rikki: Anyway, you thought everyone was asleep and you were — Sitting outside
       by yourself like you always did. And you were staring at something. You
       didn't sleep the whole night. Let me see the photo, Deek. C'mon, please.

[He hands her his photo of Sarah.]

Rikki: This is when I knew. 
Deacon: What'd you "know," Rikki?

Rikki: That I didn't want to end up — Like so many of us here — we're — trapped
       in the past, or running from it, I — I just — I wanna look forward.
       Okay? Not back.

Deacon: This isn't what you think it is. Okay?
Ripper: Get low!
Deacon: Come on — get down —
Ripper: Stay on the Path!

[They duck down to avoid being seen by noisy Rippers nearby.]

Ripper: Find them.
Ripper: Are you sure it's them?
Ripper: I saw the mark on his back. It's one of them.
Deacon: Okay —
Rikki: Wait! We're from Lost Lake Camp! Iron Mike has a treaty —
Deacon: What are you doing? Rikki — hey —

[He pulls her down, just in time to avoid being perforated by Ripper gunfire.]

Deacon: Well that was a really good idea. You wanna try that again?
Rikki: Just —
Deacon: Stay put — keep your head down —
Rikki: Hey, I can take care of myself —
Deacon: Yeah? How long you been a camper?
Rikki: A camper? Shit —
Deacon: You assholes are kinda far from home — aren't ya?
Rikki: Goddammit — What the hell are they doing up here?

Deacon: Why don't ya drag your asses back to Iron Butte and find the shithole
        ya crawled out from —

Rikki: No, no, no, no — Listen to me — we're from Lost Lake — We have a treaty!

Deacon: Little far north — aren't ya? Huh, ya don't wanna get too far away from
        Carlos — do ya? How 'bout we just leave ya here to bleed out, huh? Make
        all the Freaks out here happy, yeah? Huh? Isn't that what ya want? Oh,
        you can all just — go — straight to hell — oh yeah, nice and low down
        there for ya, huh?

[They kill all the Ripper ambushers.]

Deacon: Okay, I think that's the last of 'em.

Rikki: Oh, Jesus. Maybe you're right. I've seen Rippers before, but not like
       that. What the hell are they amped up on?

Deacon: No idea. Back in the day, dealt with a few tweakers who acted like
        that — I think they're on PCP, or whatever that other shit is —

Rikki: Oh, uh — bath salts. Remember? That was becoming a thing before

        did to Lisa —

[Rikki and Deek head back toward Lost Lake.]

Rikki: Okay, we have to follow the lines south. Check the transformers. Make

Deacon: Okay. I'm following you.
Rikki: Hey, I gotta ask you something.
Deacon: Could I stop you?
Rikki: How'd you end up in the MC?
Deacon: It's a long story —
Rikki: We got a long ride.

Deacon: Okay¹ I — I was a member of the 10th Mountain, part of a forward unit
        working with the Northern Alliance —

Rikki: Shit, I didn't know you were in the army. Why were —
Deacon: You wanna hear this or not?
Rikki: Sorry.

Deacon: We were advancing on Mazar-i-Sharif. We got ambushed by a group of
        Taliban heading the other way. And they were in flatbed trucks decked
        out with ZU-23s, modified anti-aircraft guns —

Rikki: Big guns.

Deacon: Yeah. Really big fucking guns. Our Humvee exploded, went over a cliff,
        right into the Hari. You know how hard it is to drown in Afghanistan?
        It's hard. Place is one giant Goddamn desert. Anyway, I was thrown
        clear. And when I came to — the — the Humvee was upside down in the
        river. I swam out to see if anyone survived. I¹ uh — I pulled a body
        back to shore. And I did that seven more times. And by the — by the
        time I pulled in Tanner, my sarge — I was done. And when I came home,
        I dunno — I, um — I bought a bike, spent a couple'a years on the road,
        just moving from place to place, and um —

Rikki: To Farewell? You grew up around here, right?

Deacon: Yeah — yeah. Okay, so by the time I finally settled down, I got a job
        at a bike shop run by this — by this old guy named Jack, and, uh — he
        ran the club — the, uh — well, the Prez, that's what we used to call
        him. He patched me in himself.

Rikki: Wait, Jack — I remember Boozer talking about him. He was in prison or
       something.

Deacon: Some bad shit went down and — and he ended up taking the rap, for the
        club.

Rikki: Sounds like you guys were pretty tight.

[Outside Lost Lake, they find a gas station with a shorted-out transformer.]

Rikki: Oh shit. There had to be one, right?

Deacon: Let's come back in the morning. You can get whatever tools you need
        and — We'll finish it up then. There'll be fewer Freaks out.

Rikki: So, no hot shower tonight? Okay. But I wanna show you something first.

Deacon: No — Rikki, it's been a long day —

Rikki: C'mon, you know a lot about the Freaks. I just wanna show you something
       you might not know. C'mon. We're out here anyway.

Deacon: Shit. Okay.

Rikki: Let's go.

[They start riding.]

Rikki: Can I ask you something?

Deacon: Oh God — like I said before — could I stop you?

Rikki: Why are you still flying colors?

Deacon: I don't know what you mean.

Rikki: I mean — why do you still wear the cuts? You and Boozer? It's — it's not
       like you're trying to recruit anymore, or — or staking out territory.

Deacon: No.

Rikki: A couple of guys I worked with at the plant wore colors on the weekend.
       I asked 'em about it once, an' they said they wore 'em as a way of
       saying "fuck you" to, I don't know, cops, authority, the government? So
       what are you rebelling against?

Deacon: Whatever's left. Look, we wear 'em because we wear 'em. What do you
        want? I mean, no idea about Boozer, but I ain't trying to say shit.
        It's just — the cut — that's who I am. I done a lotta stupid shit in
        my life, but joining the MC, well — let's just say that it's one of the
        few things² I don't regret.

[They drive out to an abandoned lumber mill and hop onto an outbuilding roof.]

Deacon: Rikki, what are we doin' here? I've seen the NERO death trains before,
        and Hordes —

Rikki: I know — not like this.

[A superhorde pours forth from a large factory building.]

Deacon: What the fuck?

Rikki: Watch. I've come here a few times to see them. They stay in those old
       machine buildings and they come out every night — Like someone's ringing
       a dinner bell, right? When it's morning, they go back inside and what,
       hibernate?

Deacon: You mean you never went down there to see?

Rikki: Ha ha — no. One time I got way too close and a dozen of them started
       chasing me. It's like poking a hornet's nest. C'mon, let's get outta
       here — it's getting dark.

[They quietly leave and ride for Lost Lake.]

Deacon: Okay, okay — anyway — the other day — I, uh — I saw something you won't
        believe —

Rikki: Really, you want to talk? Alright¹ let's hear it. Wait, let me guess.
       You saw a NERO helicopter.

Deacon: Wait, uh — how did you know about that?
Rikki: They've been spotted a few times. All over Lost Lake.
Deacon: Shit.

Rikki: Why do you care? It's not like they're here to help us. From the sound
       of it, they shoot on sight.

Deacon: I don't care.
Rikki: Oh. Sounded like you did.

[Around dusk, they finally pull into town.]

Addy: Hey — where the hell have you been all day?
Rikki: Nice to see you too.
Addy: Yeah, well, Skizzo said you and Deacon took off and — I — I was worried.
Rikki: Addy, I'm tired. Okay?
Addy: Oh that's rich.
Rikki: Hey, Deek — thank you.

Deacon: Yeah, well, just let me know when you're ready to tackle that
        transformer. I'll be around.

Rikki: Sure.
Addy: Bullshit.
Rikki: What is your problem?
Addy: No, no — what is your problem?
Rikki: I just said, I'm tired. That's it.

Addy: Okay. I'm sorry. Like I said, I was — I was worried. It's not like you
      to just — take off without talking to me.

Rikki: Okay.
Addy: So that's it?

[Rikki walks away and Addy storms off after her.]

Deacon: That's a day I'm never getting back. Oh, hey, look at that. Too late
        for marsh duty. Yeah, that's too bad, huh¹ Skizzo? Skizzo, Skizzo —
        speaking of Skizzo — I wonder what the hell he did all day?

[Deacon goes out to do another NERO recon mission.]

Deacon: Boozer, you there?
Boozer: Yeah, Deek.
Deacon: How ya doin'¹ brother?
Boozer: Same as always. You still out there chasing choppers?
Deacon: Yeah.
Boozer: Figure out what the hell they're up to yet?

Deacon: Not a clue. What O'Brian told me seems legit — NERO's out here, they're
        running field missions, studying the Freaks. No idea why.

Boozer: Hey, I gotta get going. Skizzo stopped by, said I'd be shovelling shit
        all day.

Deacon: Tell Skizzo to eat shit.
Boozer: Yeah, I'll pass that along. Later.

[He comes to a beacon up in the mountains.]

Deacon: O'Brian. I'm at one of your beacons. The one near Camp Creek. Uh,
        there's nothin' here.

O'Brian: Hold on. Uh, okay. A field op should be there any minute. You know
         the drill. O'Brian out.

Deacon: Yeah, I know the drill. Try not to get my ass shot off while being your
        Goddamn peeping Tom. St. John out.

[The black helo soon shows itself.]

O'Brian: This is O'Brian — are you there?

Deacon: Yeah, so — what was that all about? I mean, last time we talked, it
        sounded like you were pissin' your HAZMAT suit.

O'Brian: It's — nothing. I told you — there are people — above me who don't
         want us to know what's going on. I got too close — I almost got
         caught.

Deacon: You know what, I don't give a shit — all I want from you is information
        on Sarah —

O'Brian: — Whitaker. I've got someone working on it. It's — it's gonna take
         time. I guess — you have to be patient.

Deacon: Yeah? Well, not like I got a lotta choice here, do I¹ —

O'Brian: This research group isn't part of my unit, so I can't track them after
         this op. I need you to —

Deacon: — place a tracker on their chopper — yeah, yeah, I get it. — oh, and
        you want me to spy on the guy wearing the white space suit. Yeah.
        Anything else?

O'Brian: Yeah — try not to get your ass shot off. Your¹ uh — comm was still
         open before. Don't think of it as like being a peeping Tom — it's more
         like opposition research. O'Brian out.

Deacon: Well, it doesn't matter what you call it, I'm the one that's out here
        risking my neck.

[He creeps into the LZ, puts a bug on the chopper, then spies on a researcher
 investigating inside an abandoned shack.]

Deacon: Here we go —

Lt. Booth: Field Note Two Zero Six Eight — Another subject exhibiting the
           morphology of Stage Two infection. Tendons in the hands and fingers
           are less constricted, fingernails less clawlike, as if recently
           chewed. Additionally, the subject is wearing jewelry and clothing
           less tattered and worn than —

Cpl. Franklin: Hey, sorry. Couldn't help overhearing.
Lt. Booth: Ah, the gun-toting biology major.

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah. Something like that. So it's wearing jewelry — what's the
               significance of that?

Lt. Booth: These things have been out here for two years, scratching and
           clawing at us and each other.

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah?

Lt. Booth: Try putting a gold watch on a baboon for two years, set it loose in
           the wild, and see what happens to it.

Cpl. Franklin: Okay, okay — I get your point.
Lt. Booth: This watch looks new.
Cpl. Franklin: Really? So —

Lt. Booth: So that means this subject has either been taking care of it, or has
           recently —

Cpl. Franklin: — recently put it on — holy shit. I thought they were all, you
               know —

Lt. Booth: Batshit crazy? Yeah, they are. But just as some late stage dementia
           patients could still have moments of lucidity — victims of Stage Two
           virus infection see to retain some level of vestigial memory.

Cpl. Franklin: No shit.
Lt. Booth: No shit. Look at its clothes.
Cpl. Franklin: They're —

Lt. Booth: Almost clean — right? I mean, not clean, but — most Freaks are so
           caked with shit and piss —

Cpl. Franklin: Yeah, it's disgusting.
Lt. Booth: Yeah¹ well, again, put a pair of pants on a baboon for two years —
Cpl. Franklin: Jesus.

Lt. Booth: You ever wonder why there's so many more Freaks in areas where
           people used to live?

Cpl. Franklin: Never thought about it. But yeah, I guess they do —

Lt. Booth: Yeah. We think there might still be something — buried deep in their
           massively deformed heads — that remembers what they once were.

Cpl. Franklin: Jesus — you don't think they're aware of —

Lt. Booth: No, no. We've done the CT scans. They might as well be brain dead —
           in human terms.

Cpl. Franklin: What's that mean?
Lt. Booth: I don't know. That's what we're here to find out.

Deacon: Well, what it means, is that some Freaks get up in the morning, they
        shower, they get dressed, they put on their favorite gold watch, they
        kiss their wife goodbye, then they head out the door for a fun day of
        eating us — and shitting themselves. Why the hell are these guys
        wasting their time with this shit? Hope you got all that, O'Brian.
        Okay, now just gotta get the hell outta here. O'Brian, are you there?
        O'Brian?

O'Brian: Hold on — yeah, I'm here.
Deacon: I planted your tracking device and I got your data.
O'Brian: The researcher. Were they male or female?
Deacon: Wha — what? Why?
O'Brian: Was it a man or a woman?
Deacon: Uh, it was a woman, and no, I didn't catch her name.
O'Brian: Okay. I'll be in touch. O'Brian out.

[After visiting the hydroelectric dam, Deacon radios in to Lost Lake.]

Deacon: Hey, Rikki, you there? I'm, uh — I'm gonna be gone for awhile, I'm
        gonna need you to cover me. Skizzo's gonna wonder why I'm not out on
        marsh duty or whatever the hell.

Rikki: Hey¹ Deek — what's up?

Deacon: Boozer's, uh — hell, I don't know. He's — he's depressed or something.
        Talk to Addy. I think I know a way to cheer him up.

Rikki: So, what are you gonna do?

Deacon: I don't know. Uh — I thought I'd maybe head to O'Leary Mountain, get
        his bike, bring it back.

Rikki: That's a long way to go on foot —
Deacon: I'll figure somethin' out. Are — are you gonna cover for me, or what?
Rikki: Yeah.
Deacon: Thanks¹ Rikki. Deacon out.

[Deek returns to the old mountain's safehouse, killing two prowlers nearby.
 He takes Boozer's bike all the way to Lost Lake afterwards.]

Deacon: Hey, I brought you something.
Boozer: Wait, what the fuck? You — you went up and got my bike?
Deacon: Well, I didn't want Cope gettin' it — partin' it out.
Boozer: Jesus, Deek —

Deacon: Hey — I mean, I mostly — did it, you know, in case I need parts — It's
        not like your gimp ass is gonna need 'em —

Boozer: Shit. Thanks, brother. That's the one thing I miss. Ridin' on the open

[Boozer sits on his hog, but missing an arm, it doesn't feel the same.]

Boozer: Oh fuck —

[Boozer gets off and walks away. Meanwhile, Rikki radios in.]

Rikki: Deek — Addy just wanted me to tell you that she paid some men to go get
       your bike and bring it back. It's over at the mechanic's shop.

Deacon: Uh — wait — what —
Rikki: You're welcome, Deek. Rikki out.

[Later on...]

Copeland: St. John. This is Mark Copeland to Deacon St. John.
Deacon: Hey, Cope — what's up?

Copeland: Just checkin' in. Couple of my men were up to the top of O'Leary
          Mountain the other day, said they found a safe house set up in an
          old Forest Service watch tower —

Deacon: Is that right?

Copeland: Yes¹ sir, that's what I'm told — they said it was abandoned, but —
          funny thing — whoever lived there, left behind a bike — in good shape
          too, by the sound of it —

Deacon: Really?

Copeland: Indeed. But that's not the funny thing — the funny thing —  is they
          went back up there today to pick it up but — the bike was gone. Now
          ain't that a head scratcher?

Deacon: Look, Cope — this is all really fascinating, but, uh —

Copeland: Now hold on — here's the fascinatin' part — they swear that old bike,
          well — it looked a lot like the one Boozer used to ride —

Deacon: Okay — so let me get this straight, Cope. You guys went up to O'Leary
        Mountain, you found — what you thought was Boozer's bike — and the
        first thing ya thought of was, "Hey, why — why don't we just go back
        and steal it?"

Copeland: Salvage, Deek, Salvage. But no, that was my second thought. My first
          was, whatever happened to ol' Boozer? Manny says he hasn't seen him
          around for some time.

Deacon: I don't know, Cope. Next time I see him, I'll let him know how much
        you miss him. St. John out.

Boozer: Scuse¹ me, I ain't got time to fuckin' chit-chat.
Deacon: Alright, don't work too hard.

[Deacon leaves, hearing another truther broadcast afterwards.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. 'Bout a
          month before shit went down, I wrote in my newsletter, Farewell
          Freedom: store a year's worth of food and water, because I knew, no
          matter what was coming, we were all nine meals from anarchy. I
          figured, if I could get a few people prepared — the ones who'd really
          listen — then maybe we'd survive when it all finally collapsed down
          on our heads. But not as many listened as I'd hoped. Now, those
          supplies are runnin' out and folks are goin' hungry. Remember the
          parable of the ant and the grasshopper? Well us "ants," who prepared
          and stored for future calamity, didn't have the heart to starve out
          you "grasshoppers" who danced while the sun was shining without a
          worry in your head for what calamities the future would bring. Now
          we're all paying the price. Are we gonna starve? I don't know. Fish
          runs are thinning out. Game is getting scarce. Can't remember the
          last time I saw a buck or a doe. But I'll tell you this much, we're
          not turning on each other. No sir, we'll never do that. This is Mark
          Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Goddamn truther bullshit. You know, last I checked, the "grasshoppers"
        all armed themselves to the teeth, came in, and killed all your fucking
        ants, and took everything you owned. So — if you're gonna tell
        parables, Cope. Just — get 'em right.

[Later...]

Deacon: Hey¹ Addy, you there?

Addy: Deacon, yes, I'm here.

Deacon: Hey, so, uh — I — I don't think that — that he's doin' so well. I don't
        know. I guess — I'm really worried about him.

Addy: Yeah, me too — when he stopped by he seemed — I don't know. Angry.
      Depressed.

Deacon: Look, I'll keep an eye on him. I'll — I'm gonna make sure he do
        anything stupid. I'll see what I can do — I don't know —

Addy: You do that, Deacon. It'll mean a lot to him. Infirmary out.

 and Skizzo are pouring over a map in the firelight.]

Iron Mike: Okay, that's your best bet. Right there.
Skizzo: I don't know about that, Mike. We lost people in there before.
Iron Mike: We lost — we lost — who? When?

Skizzo: A few weeks back. Torres and Evans. Lookin' for supplies. I told you
        that they —

Iron Mike: No, Goddammit — you didn't.

Skizzo: I told you. That we went after 'em — but the entrance was caved in.
        Their bikes were outside but the place was crawlin'? You remember? I
        don't even know if they made it inside.

Deacon: What's the trouble?
Iron Mike: We just — we're going over the papers, the ones from Sherman's Camp.
Deacon: Mm-hmm.
Iron Mike: There was a mine that was gettin' ready to expand.
Deacon: Sure, and there's probably explosives stored onsite¹.

Iron Mike: Yeah. Except now Skizzo tells me we may have lost two men on the

Iron Mike: Alright, you knock it off. Knock it off! Hey, you don't trust him?
           You go with him. But you remember somethin' — both of you —
           Remember — we are all part of the same camp.

Skizzo: That's fine. Fine by me. In the morning, we'll take our bikes and we'll
        go —

Deacon: We'll go right now.
Skizzo: Now.
Deacon: Yeah.
Skizzo: Now. In the middle of the night.
Deacon: Sure. You know it's dark out, there'll be less Freaks inside the mine.

Skizzo: Oh that's right. Oh, since you been skippin' work, you've been chasin'
        down black choppers — And now you're some kinda Freak expert. Is that
        it?

Deacon: Looks like we should be able to squeeze in through here. Give me a
        hand. Here — push —

Skizzo: I'm pushin', I'm pushin' —
Deacon: There — wedge it against that boulder —
Skizzo: Got it —
Deacon: There —

[The fallen beam is placed horizontally again.]

Skizzo: Look stable to you?
Deacon: Stable enough —

[They enter the mine and Skizzo pops a flare.]

Deacon: Remember, keep your gun holstered.
Skizzo: I thought you said it was gonna be clear.

Deacon: I never said that — and I mean it. If there are any Freaks in here,
        one shot will bring 'em right down on our heads.

Skizzo: I heard ya already. Jesus. Okay, first expansion area is right off
        the main shaft. C'mon, this way.

Deacon: Right behind you.
Skizzo: Ah shit. We're not gettin' under that.
Deacon: Look at the map. Is there another tunnel? A ventilation shaft?

Skizzo: Map shows they started a connecting tunnel here. Looks like it was
        unstable, so they boarded it up.

Deacon: Where?

Skizzo: Eh, back this way.

Deacon: Here?

Skizzo: Yeah.

Deacon: Yeah, looks like they boarded it up. Well, this doesn't look exactly
        stable.

Skizzo: I thought I already said that — all I got is this. You got the
        flashlight. You have the honors.

[Deacon kicks down the "do not cross" barrier for the connecting tunnel.]

Deacon: Maybe there's a reason they never completed any of this expansion work.
        I mean it seems like one stick of dynamite will bring this whole place
        down on our heads.

Skizzo: Doesn't seem so bad.

[No sooner have they crossed the path than a tunnel-sealing cave-in occurs.]

Skizzo: Go, go! Look out!
Deacon: Jesus. You alright?
Skizzo: No broken bones. Jesus — yeah.
Deacon: Oh — that was close.
Skizzo: Well, we're committed to this shit now. C'mon. This way.
Deacon: What're you doin'?
Skizzo: What's it look like? I'm droppin' flares.
Deacon: Why? You got the map.

Skizzo: This thing's a fucking maze? Gonna need help knowing which tunnels
        we've checked.

[Deacon draws his attention to a pair of corpses in a shadowed corner.]

Deacon: C'mere —
Skizzo: What?
Deacon: These your men?

Skizzo: Yeah. Every time I saw Torres, he had on this same damned vest. I kept
        tellin' him, wearin' bright orange's gonna get you killed, bro. I guess
        it didn't matter in here.

Deacon: His buddy lost the arm. Bled out and — kept Torres fed for a week.
Skizzo: You ever resort to that?
Deacon: There's a few lines I haven't crossed. That's one of 'em.
Skizzo: Yeah. Me either. Stand back. I'm not leavin' 'em for the Freaks.

[He tosses a molotov on the corpses.]

Deacon: Let's get the hell outta here.
Skizzo: Yeah. Come on, we can squeeze through here.
Deacon: Following you.
Skizzo: That's a tight squeeze — you got this?
Deacon: Who sits on his ass all day in the camp?
Skizzo: Oh, very funny — c'mon.

[They move through a rock fissure into another part of the tunnel.]

Skizzo: Okay — the first expansion area should be around this corner.
Deacon: If you're readin' the map right.
Skizzo: I'm readin' it right. See? You still got the keys?
Deacon: Yeah, right here.

[He unlocks the strongbox. Skizzo checks it afterwards.]

Deacon: Nothing. It's empty.
Skizzo: Shit.
Deacon: Oh, I'm sorry. Did you not believe me?
Skizzo: Sure. I believed you. Come on. Maybe they put 'em all in one place.
Deacon: Sonofabitch.

Skizzo: Let's go check the other one. This way. Let's double back. Make sure
        we didn't miss any side tunnels.

Deacon: Skizzo, hold up, hold up. This doesn't seem right.
Skizzo: What — what're you talking about?
Deacon: This isn't the way we came in.
Skizzo: What, you think these flares got up and moved themselves?
Deacon: Maybe I got turned around.

[They continue on.]

Deacon: Now, wait a minute Goddammit. This is the main tunnel.
Skizzo: What?

Deacon: It's the — it's the main tunnel. You see the tracks? We weren't
        following any tracks on our way in.

Skizzo: What the hell? But these are my flares, dammit. How did they — Oh,
        someone's fucking with us. C'mon, this way.

[They follow the flares into a larger chamber. Skizzo waves his piece around.]

Deacon: Hold up, hold up, wait a second —
Skizzo: Who the hell's in here? Come on out! Show yourself!
Deacon: Skizzo — put that thing away.
Skizzo: What're you talkin' about?

Deacon: What I'm talking about is one shot — one — That's all it takes to bring
        all the Freaks in these tunnels down on top of us.

Skizzo: I thought you said these tunnels would be clear this time of night.
Deacon: No, what I said —

[A newt jumps on top of Deacon, taking him unawares.]

Skizzo: What the hell! Look out! I can't get a shot —
Deacon: Oh Goddammit. Goddammit¹ it's got the keys!
Skizzo: Oh — shit! Where you goin'?
Deacon: It's got the keys! We gotta catch it.
Skizzo: Wait — come back —
Deacon: Goddammit Skizzo — it's gettin' away!

[Deacon tracks and chases the Newt, leaving Skizzo alone in the chamber.]

Deacon: Dammit¹ you little shit — get back here. C'mon, you shit. Gimme back
        those fuckin' keys. Where'd you go —

[Deacon kills the Newt and reclaims the keys. He can hear gunfire further in
 and runs to help Skizzo as he's attacked by Freakers.]

Skizzo: Goddammit. Get off me.
Deacon: Dammit, Skizzo!
Skizzo: No — no!
Deacon: What the hell was he thinking — Oh, Skizzo! Skizzo — stop shooting!
Skizzo: What?
Deacon: Dammit¹ Skizzo, you're bringing the whole mine down on us —
Skizzo: Ah dammit — okay, okay —
Deacon: Put the gun down —
Skizzo: What the hell are you talkin' about?

[They finally kill all the attackers.]

Deacon: Looks like the last of 'em —
Skizzo: So much for the tunnels bein' clear —
Deacon: I told you what would happen if you fired your weapon.
Skizzo: What was I supposed to do? Throw rocks at 'em?
Deacon: What you're supposed to do, is you're supposed to fuckin' listen to me
        — Next time — Try this.

Skizzo: Whatever.
Deacon: You're welcome.
Skizzo: For what?
Deacon: For savin' your ass.
Skizzo: If you hadn't run off, my ass wouldn't need saving.
Deacon: Well, you ready to fucking finish this?
Skizzo: Yeah, I'm ready. This way.

[They continue on past the Freaker ambush area.]

Skizzo: So — your bro's arm — Addy said it looked like somebody tried to burn
        his tats off. It was the Rippers, wasn't it?

Deacon: You got a point, Skizzo?

Skizzo: Had a Drifter come in. Word's gone out, Rippers are looking for two
        men, Mongrels? Sound like anyone you know?

Deacon: Well, as you can see, I'm still wearing the cut. We're not hiding,
        Skizzo — if Carlos wants Boozer, he won't have any trouble finding
        him — but he's gonna have to go through me first.

Skizzo: What'd you do to him? Gotta be something long before breaking the
        treaty.

Deacon: Long before I — you know what? I don't know, and I don't care. Have I
        killed a few Rippers in my day? You're Goddamn right I have. And after
        what they did to Boozer? I'm gonna go right on killing the crazy
        sonsofbitches.

Skizzo: Yeah, and Carlos is crazier than any of 'em. You don't wanna be on his
        shit list, bro.

Deacon: What did I just say? I don't care, and I'm not your bro — remember what
        I told Iron Mike? Carlos can go fuck himself.

Skizzo: Hey, just lookin' out for ya. You're one of us now, right?

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. Right. Don't worry about me and Boozer. We can look out
        for ourselves.

[They enter a storeroom deep in the mine.]

Deacon: Bingo.

[With some effort, they use a mine cart to get the TNT to the entrance.]

Deacon: What're you talkin' about?
Skizzo: You know the old man — same as me.
Deacon: I got this. I got it.

Skizzo: Thanks. He thinks that his treaty with the Rippers is gonna keep us
        safe. The thing is? They don't give a shit about any treaty. The only
        reason they haven't come down here in force is because — They're too
        busy up north, hittin' Copeland, the Hot Springs —

Deacon: Yeah, I know. I was there.

Skizzo: So you know what I'm talkin' about. The Rippers are comin'. And Iron
        Mike — he's just gonna — let it happen. He's gonna let those
        bald-headed Freak-a-likes wash over us like a Goddamned red tide.

Deacon: Skizzo, you don't know that.
Skizzo: Don't I?
Deacon: Come on.
Skizzo: Jesus — never thought I'd be so glad to see the light a' day.

Deacon: Shit — something else we agree on, that's twice in one day —

[He hears something and peeks around the corner, spotting foes by the bikes.]

Deacon: Hold up for a second — Marauders —
Skizzo: Yeah, c'mon —

Marauder: Mister, my boys got a little rambunctious, I admit it — they're a
          little jumpy out here, ya know? You come on out and talk to me and
          I'll settle 'em down — Come on, mister, we don't mean you no harm —
          this is all just a misunderstanding, it is — we're lookin' for you
          to, like, join up with us — can use the help, whaddya say? Hey¹
          Drifter, I like your style — you got what it takes to survive out
          here — why don't you, uh, lower your weapons, come out and chat for
          a bit — see if we can't reach — an agreement — Mister, how you doin'
          — you know my boys kinda amped up, if I'm bein' honest — if you come
          out now, maybe I can stop 'em from killin' ya — whaddya say? Come
          out here and talk to us —

Deacon: Alright, uh, split up — we'll surround 'em.
Skizzo: Got it — watch your back —

[Deacon finally makes his move, taking out some Marauders.]

Skizzo: Yeah, you got it — lay it into 'em. Haha, give it to 'em — Shoot the
        assholes —

[He finally kills all the enemies.]

Deacon: Hey¹ sister — thought you just wanted to talk — I guess — that's all
        I gotta say —

Skizzo: I think that's all the bastards —
Deacon: Yeah —

Skizzo: Come on, we gotta get that box-o-dynamite — Musta been — the same
        assholes — who parted out the bikes — ride by, an' they seen ours —
        figured they'd make an easy score.

Deacon: I guess it wasn't as easy as they'd hoped —

Skizzo: You know — I hate to say it — but we actually make a good team, you
        and I —

Deacon: Then don't say it —

Skizzo: Hey, there's somethin' I gotta say — When you and Boozer rode into
        camp, and Iron Mike welcomed you back again — With Goddamn open arms —
        I thought it was another sign the old man was losin' it — goin' soft.

Deacon: Okay, what's your point, Skizzo?

Skizzo: My point — is that you and me? We see eye to eye. I get that now. You
        know, same as me — If Iron Mike don't wake the hell up, the camp's not
        gonna last another six months.

Deacon: Okay, still waitin' for your point —

Skizzo: Look, I know I've been bustin' your balls, we both know that, but —
        Lotta people know what you done, for your friend, how you've been doin'
        shit for the camp. Changes are comin', brother. When Iron Mike —
        "retires," let's call it — I say you and me? We step up and run the
        camp together.

Deacon: You and me. Run the camp. That's really what you wanted to talk to me
        about.

Skizzo: Hey, hear me out, Goddammit. Just listen to me a minute.
Deacon: Uh-huh —

Skizzo: Look, I got a lot of friends on the camp council — and they agree —
        Most of 'em say the old man's gotta go.

Deacon: Yeah, that's bullshit because Rikki would never go for it —
Skizzo: She's as soft as the old man, and you —
Deacon: And Mike trusts you.
Skizzo: Well, that's his mistake. One of many.

Deacon: Well it ain't gonna be mine. Look — We all do things to survive,
        Skizzo, I get that. But you remember how I said there's some lines I
        ain't crossed? Stabbin' a friend in the back — that's one of 'em.

Skizzo: Better one old man — than the entire camp. You think about that.

[Skizzo rides off with the TNT box.]

Deacon: Yeah, Skizzo — I'll think about that. Jesus, why would Iron Mike ever
        trust that asshole? Let alone — make him head of security? Lost Lake
        Camp, come in. Deacon St. John to Iron Mike.

Iron Mike: Deek — you and Skizzo, you find 'em? The explosives?

Deacon: Yeah, Mike — we got 'em. Skizzo's on his way back with everything that
        we found. Listen, Mike — I gotta tell ya —

Iron Mike: That's great — that's great. Now, we can't use 'em until we find
           some det cord, you know that right? I'll take a look through the
           files we got —

Deacon: Mike — listen to me. Skizzo, he's¹ um —
Iron Mike: Jesus, what now? You boys try and shoot your damn heads off again?
Deacon: No, Mike — but he, uh — he wants to run the camp, Mike, he told me —

Iron Mike: Oh hell, I know all about that. Remember, I told you already. Skizzo
           thinks I'm a pacifist, and I'm gonna get us all killed. I know he's
           been talkin' —

Deacon: Mike —

Iron Mike: Deek — like I said. Skizzo's got his issues, but — it's not like we
           don't got ours. Thanks for your concern — but I can take care of
           myself. Mike out.

Deacon: Uh, Jesus — alright. Have it your way, Iron Mike. You always do.

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Today I want
          to talk about drugs. Now, I don't much care for 'em. They keep you
          numb, unreliable, and silent. In 1996, the CIA was accused of dealing
          cocaine in Central America. Used it to help them control the masses,
          get the Feds' sticky fingers on a slice of the global pie. And once
          they figured out how well that shit worked, well — they decided to
          set their sights here at home — make drug addicts of us good old
          American taxpayers. They brought cocaine up from South American by
          the planeload, barrels of the stuff, got us hooked on it, kept us
          complacent — kept us high — kept us under the heel of their rich
          boots. And oh, did they get profit from our misery. The Feds made
          millions to fund their secret operations, all while destroying the
          very heart and soul of this good country. But thankfully, at last,
          all that is in the past. At least for my people. Stay sober¹ people.
          Stay alive. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't
          believe the lies.

Deacon: Yeah? You ever lose an arm, Cope? Maybe when you do you'll find
        yourself wanting a bottle of whiskey — or two — or three. In the
        meantime, shut the hell up.

Deacon: Where's Boozer?
Skizzo: I dunno.
Deacon: What do you mean, "you don't know."¹ I thought he was with you?
Skizzo: Yeah¹ he was, and then he — he took off — some shit.
Deacon: Skizzo — what the fuck are you tellin' me —

Deacon: Alright, here's the farm. This is where Rikki said the work crew was.
        Boozer? You there? Boozeman? Dammit. Okay here's the farm. Hey —
        where's Boozer?

Guard: Who? No, there's no one here. The work crew's gone home for the day.
Boozer: No, he's still here. The big guy, with one arm.

Guard: Yeah, yeah. I know who you mean. He headed off that way, towards the
       old farm house. Thought he was getting a ride there.

Deacon: If you see him — tell him, tell him to stay here. Radio me or Rikki.
Guard: Sure¹ man, whatever.

[Deek rides to the next-door farm.]

Deacon: Boozer? You there? Boozeman? Where the hell are you, Boozeman? Skizzo

        bottle of whiskey? One of these, uh — farmhouses? This has gotta be it.

Boozer: Deek! I — wait, I thought you were gonna come, um — have a beer with
        me — and take a walk —

Deacon: Boozer, just where are you? Would you look around — would ya tell me
        what you see — what's nearby? Gimme a — gimme a landmark or something.

Boozer: Huh, already told you — oh — oh, look at that shit —

Deacon: Look at what, Boozer? Whaddya see?

Boozer: The road — the road's, ah wow, it's jus' — gone — like, like somebody

Boozer: Home — that's where I'm goin' — home —

Deacon: Just stay right there — just stay where you are — get down, get out of

Boozer: I'm not hidin' from no one — I'm goin' home — Deek — home —

Deacon: Dammit¹ Boozer —

[Deacon mounts up yet again.]

Deacon: Broken road — broken road — He can't have gone far — where the hell was
        the road washed out?

[Deek follows Boozer's trail, coming across some litter on the valley highway.]

Deacon: What's that? Another beer bottle. Gotta take a closer look. Alright —
        where — You're mine now. That's gotta be him — Bootprints — bingo —
        Boozer — you there? I'm getting close — I, uh — I followed your
        tracks — just like you taught me — uh — Boozer, come on¹ man. Stay
        put, will ya?

[He travels the broken, car-choked path and finds a drunken Boozer walking.]

Boozer: Oof, old McDonald had a farm — ee, eye — hic — ee eye, oh

Deacon: There he is! Little late for a stroll.
Boozer: Deek! How's it goin'¹ old buddy?
Deacon: Boozer, where're you goin'?
Boozer: Home. That's where I'm goin' — home sweet home.
Deacon: Oh, we can't go back to O'Leary Mountain.
Boozer: No¹ I'm not goin' to fuckin' O'Leary Mountain — I'm goin' to Farewell —
Deacon: Oh shit — c'mon, we gotta get —
Boozer: No, no — you don't wanna be doing that¹ brother.
Deacon: No — you wanna take a swing at me? Fine — get in line, behind them.

[He points to a hungry horde across the broken road's gap.]

Boozer: Great. Alright. Bring it!
Deacon: Okay. So this is it? This is how we're goin' out?
Boozer: Go on. Get outta here, brother.
Deacon: No, no, I don't think so. Huh, Boozer? Huh? Boozer.
Boozer: Bro —
Deacon: The night your old lady was killed — what did I say to you?
Boozer: What, the night Joany —

Deacon: Huh? What did I say to you, huh? I found you halfway through a case of
        whiskey. You were gonna drink yourself to death. What did I say to you?

Boozer: You grabbed a bottle, and you chugged it — it was a lot of Goddamn
        whiskey. And you told me if I was gonna drink myself to death — You'd
        be right there with me. That's what brothers do.

Deacon: So like I said, Boozer — is this it? This how we're going out?

[The horde notices them and immediately starts pursuing. The two hurriedly get
 on the bike and speed off as quickly as humanly possible.]

Boozer: Fine, let's get the hell outta here. Go, go go —
Deacon: I'm going —
Boozer: Well go faster then — Cars — wrecked cars —
Deacon: I see 'em¹ Boozer!
Boozer: Ah shit, Freaks!
Deacon: Oh, I see 'em¹ Boozer!

[They eventually outrun the enemies.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em — we're gonna be okay —
Boozer: I know — I knew — it all along — Hey, hey¹ Deek —
Deacon: Boozer, listen —
Boozer: No, I jus' — I jus' wanna say — thank you¹ man — I mean it —
Deacon: Boozer, uh —

Boozer: No, no, jus' — jus' listen Goddammit — you came out here and you saved
        my sorry ass — again. I owe you¹ brother — I owe you.

Deacon: No — no, Boozer. I owe — alright¹ look. If it weren't for you, I, uh —
        I woulda been dead a long time ago — or worse.

Boozer: I thought you said — there was nothin' worse than bein' dead —

Deacon: Yeah, well I was wrong.

[Finally, they arrive at Lost Lake.]

Deacon: You gonna be okay?
Boozer: Oh, hell yeah — I hear a bunk callin' my name.

[Boozer walks back home.]

Rikki: Deek, did you find him?
Deacon: Yeah, Rikki — I found him.
Rikki: How is he?

Deacon: Well, let's just say that tomorrow's¹ he's gonna have one helluva
        hangover.

Rikki: A hangover — good, I'll remember that when I stop by to see him at six
       in the morning.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. Thank God.

Rikki: He deserves it. Deek, I'm glad he's okay.

[In town, Deacon finds Rikki as she works under a truck.]

Deacon: Hey, Rikki, I¹ uh — I got a favor to ask.
Rikki: Yeah, what's up¹ Deek?

Deacon: Um, it's about Boozer's arm. Uh, I saw that hook that you made for
        him, and uh — It's great. But uh — don't you think it might be better
        if — Instead of a hook — I don't know, maybe it was something like a
        knife, or a blade or something. You know? Uh —

Rikki: Oh — oh, hold on — Help, please — thank you. 
Deacon: So if —

Rikki: I'm sorry about that. So uh — you — you want me to — You want me to
       create a prosthetic — blade for Boozer?

Deacon: Well, yeah, I just thought it might cheer him up, make him feel, you
        know — more of a —

Rikki: You want me to weaponize Boozer?

Deacon: I wouldn't put it that way —

Rikki: I'm just fuckin' with you, Deek. I think it's a great idea. Uh — I will
       go check some parts and I will radio what I need. Cool?

Deacon: Okay.
Rikki: Okay.
Deacon: Uh —

[Deacon sets out and the radio clicks on before long.]

Iron Mike: Hey, Deek, I got a good one for ya —

Deacon: Mike, hey — what's up?

Iron Mike: Rikki handed me a shoppin' list, said it was for Boozer? Said I
           should radio you.

Deacon: Okay — where's Rikki?

Iron Mike: Somethin' came up with Addy — I don't ask. Anyway — she needs a
           galvanized metal pipe, tube — kind used in building. She needs a
           — carbon alloy blade, the kind hunters use, and finally, some metal
           scrap. That list make any sense to ya?

Deacon: Uh — yeah, Mike. Like you said. I don't ask. Deacon out. Okay, what do
        I need? I need a blade, or — metal tube — scrap — Ah, Jesus, Rikki —
        Metal tube, metal tube — can't just be any metal tube, can it? Gotta
        find one from a — construction site. Wait, wait, wait — hold on a
        second — there was a — house? Um — under construction at — Marion
        Forks. Bet I can find somethin' there —

[En route to Marion Forks:]

Deacon: Boozer? You up? This is Deek — Must be sleeping.
Boozer: Deek? That you?
Deacon: Shit. Sorry¹ man, I — I didn't mean to wake ya.

Boozer: Brother — after workin' a shovel all day — I pretty much pass out as
        soon as I hit the bunk. What's going on?

Deacon: Just checkin' on you, brother. Just — makin' sure that you didn't —
        you know, wander off on another midnight dance with a Horde.

Boozer: Hey, don't worry 'bout me. From the sound of it, you're the one out on
        a joy ride. Hey, I gotta get some shut-eye — talk later. Out.

[Eventually, Deek reaches Marion Forks construction site.]

Deacon: Metal tube — where are ya — Here we go — Huh, that'll do it — Blade —
        where am I gonna find a blade? Wait, wait, wait — where — where was
        that sporting goods store?

[He goes up the block to the ransacked building.]

Deacon: Here it is — Now — just gotta find a blade — Okay — let's take a look
        around. Alright — where — You're mine now. Here we go — Well, this
        oughta be enough — Now I just gotta — get all this crap back to Rikki.

[After taking the blade from a corpse, Deek heads back to Lost Lake.]

Deacon: Hey —
Rikki: Hey.
Deacon: I got those parts that you asked for.
Rikki: Oh, great. Well, uh — check back in a few. I'll see what I can do, yeah?
Deacon: Uh, Rikki — thanks.
Rikki: Yeah. Boozer's one of us now.

[Later, while Deacon's outside of town:]

Rikki: Hey¹ Deek, you there? I've got Boozer's new prosthetic ready. I asked
       Addy to find him and send him over.

Deacon: Uh, great, great, Rikki. I'll, uh — I'll be right there. Deacon out.

[Deek goes back to the town garage, finding Boozer being fitted.]

Boozer: Just right in the — crease there.
Rikki: Okay. Okay, I got it. Lemme secure it in, okay?
Boozer: There you go. That's better.
Rikki: Okay —
Boozer: Hey¹ brother, look what Rikki did. Made me a new toy!

[He shows off his new prosthetic blade.]

Rikki: Oh, what —

Rikki: Yeah — whoa! Okay —

Deacon: That's pretty — Jesus — hold on — whoa, whoa, whoa!

[While walking around Lost Lake, Deacon gets a call.]

O'Brian: St. John. You there? It's O'Brian.

Deacon: Hold on. O'Brian, I'm sick of doing your dirty work. You got news for
        me or not?

O'Brian: Yeah. I — I mean — yes. I have news.
Deacon: Well then, what is it?
O'Brian: I — need you to do one last job.
Deacon: Were you listenin' to what I was just sayin'? I'm done with this.
O'Brian: One more job. Then I'll meet you in person. Show you what I got.
Deacon: Forget it.

O'Brian: Her middle name. It was "Irene," right? Sarah Irene Whitaker. It's on
         her admission form.

Deacon: One last job.
O'Brian: One — last job. I sent you the coordinates. O'Brian out.

[He hurriedly walks to his bike, passing by Boozer.]

Deacon: Hey.
Boozer: Hey. You're headed somewhere in a hurry.
Deacon: Yeah. You remember that NERO bastard I told you about? O'Brian?
Boozer: Mm-hmm —

Deacon: Well it looks like he's got some news for me, but I gotta do one last
        job for him first.

Boozer: Yeah — okay.
Deacon: You should come with me.

Boozer: Yeah? Nah, I — Skizzo's got me on farm duty. Feedin' the world one
        shitty weed at a time.

Deacon: Fuck Skizzo. I'll drop you off right afterward. When's the last time
        you saw a helicopter?

[He tosses his hoe aside.]

Boozer: I'll tell him you twisted my arm.
Deacon: Never gets old, does it?

[They head out towards the coordinates.]

Boozer: Where we headed?
Deacon: Over toward Melakwa Lake. You know where that is?

Boozer: Yeah, it's just north of the Rogue Tunnel, offa Waldo Road. So what
        are we doin' there?

Deacon: A NERO chopper's gonna be on the ground, doing whatever the hell it is
        that they do. O'Brian wants me to see what they're up to.

Boozer: So O'Brian, he's, uh — he's what — your, your shot caller? Handler?
Deacon: No, Jesus — Boozer — you know why the hell we're out here.
Boozer: Just askin' — seems like he tells ya to jump, you ask "how high" —
Deacon: That's not how it is. So how you holdin' up?

Boozer: Not bad. Uh, it's been worse, you know? I actually don't mind workin'
        the farm, pullin' weeds and shit. Reminds me of when I was a kid. I
        used to go out to my uncle's farm out at uh, by Adrian, on the Idaho
        border. I'd spend summers working the beet fields. He had a little
        dirt bike I'd tool around on. That's where I learned to ride.

Deacon: If you're not careful, I'm gonna start calling you Farmer Bill. When
        we get to that site, stay close. Whatever happens — just — don't let
        'em see you. They can get a little trigger happy.

Boozer: Okay, okay, got it. Stay down, keep my mouth shut, don't get us killed.
        Hey, thanks for bringin' me along, Deek. It's good to get out again.
        Even ridin' bitch. You know?

Deacon: Yeah.

[He goes out to the old Camp Pioneer site and dismounts with Boozer. A black
 chopper soon arrives.]

Deacon: Okay. Stay close.
Boozer: Right behind you.
Deacon: I haven't heard that for a while.
Boozer: Yeah.
Deacon: There it is.
Boozer: Jesus. Never thought I'd see one of those again, in the air¹ I mean.

Deacon: Alright, now watch. Soldiers come out first, they secure the LZ, then
        their boy genius — researcher, scientist, whatever the hell — he comes
        out, he looks around.

Boozer: To do what?

Deacon: Whatever science shit they're doing out here. How the hell would I
        know?

Boozer: You're the one who's been spyin' on 'em.
Deacon: Okay, wait here.
Boozer: You got it.

[Deacon nears the scientist.]

Cpl. Fernandez: Hey, what ya got there¹ doc?
Lt. Simpson: Really? Okay, if you must know — we're picking up scat samples.
Cpl. Fernandez: You mean — shit?
Lt. Simpson: Yes.
Cpl. Fernandez: Freak shit?
Lt. Simpson: Yes.

Cpl. Fernandez: So, we're out here in the middle of nowhere, so you can pick
                up Freak shit?

Lt. Simpson: Precisely.
Cpl. Fernandez: Okay. 'Nuff said.

Lt. Simpson: Field Note Two One Zero Two. After analysis of scat samples from
             Zones Two, Three and Four B, there is clear evidence of Claytonia
             perfoliata —

Cpl. Fernandez: What's that?

Lt. Simpson: Commonly known as miner's lettuce — please don't interrupt — as
             well as monoecious berries from Juniperus communis.

Cpl. Fernandez: So — why do we care?

Lt. Simpson: Why do we care? Because it means the Freaks are eating more than
             just us and each other. They're eating berries, plants, grass,
             needles — basically anything a deer would eat. They're omnivores.
             Just like us. But with stomachs that can digest a much wider range
             of cellulose.

Cpl. Fernandez: Yeah — okay, and — what?

Lt. Simpson: It means they're not going to starve when they run out of 'us' to
             eat. Freaks aren't going away any time soon.

Cpl. Fernandez: Shit. That's bad.
Lt. Simpson: Yeah, that's bad. I'm done here.
Deacon: Okay, uh, head back to the bike.

[He creeps back to Boozer's position.]

Deacon: You catch any of that over my radio?

Boozer: That's pretty fucked up. Good taxpayer money, and they're out here
        collectin' Freaker shit.

Deacon: Yeah, I told you, who knows what they're doin', or why.

Boozer: Well, they gotta have a base around here somewhere, right? You try
        followin' 'em?

Deacon: Yeah, but they always disappear over the mountains, headin' south. And
        with the highway choked off — I can never get close.

Boozer: Sonsofbitches. Seems like they got a lot to answer for.
Deacon: Yeah —

[Deacon and Boozer mount back up following the LZ excursion.]

Boozer: Where we headed now?
Deacon: It's a good question. O'Brian, are you there? Come in, O'Brian.
O'Brian: I'm here. Finished?
Deacon: Yeah, it's done. Where am I meeting you?

O'Brian: I wasn't expecting you so soon. I'm sending you the coordinates now.
         But it might take a few minutes to get there. O'Brian out.

Deacon: Jesus, what the hell does he think I've been doing out here?
Boozer: Hey, you're right about one thing. He does sound like an asshole.

[They ride up to a hill near Rogue Camp.]

Deacon: You wait here. I don't want him getting skittish because I brought
        someone along.

Boozer: Yeah, I'll keep an eye on the bike. I've seen enough NERO assholes for
        one day.

Deacon: Okay. I'll be back. O'Brian said he had news — he knew her middle name
        — "Irene" — She can't be alive — But he's alive — why not her? Huh?
        There he is.

[He crowns the embankment to find O'Brian waiting around.]

Deacon: Yo.
O'Brian: Shit — you gotta stop doing that.
Deacon: What you got?

O'Brian: Alright, look — I'm gonna lay it out for you, but it's not good news.
         I finally found a guy who was willing to do some digging through some
         files that we — They — they — used to keep, while they still kept
         records.

Deacon: Okay, O'Brian.

O'Brian: Anyway — Sarah Whitaker — your wife — was — Admitted into the camp
         MASH unit on the salt flats, outside of Silver Lake. According to the
         records she was in surgery for six hours, and then was moved — to —

[Deacon snatches his clipboard.]

Deacon: Okay, so she survived — the stab wound. She survived.

O'Brian: Yeah, yeah. According to the records, she made a full recovery. Then
         she was moved to another camp, on the outskirts of Chemult —

Deacon: Okay, so — so she could still be alive — Even after all this time she
        could still be alive — you're sayin' that —

O'Brian: No.

Deacon: Whaddya mean, "no"?

O'Brian: It was overrun. Everything was overrun. There were no survivors.

Deacon: You survived. They survived.

O'Brian: No — look, look, look, there was nothing that would have protected
         that camp, okay? Highway 97 was — was — is — an artery — Infected —
         Freaks — poured up from L.A., from the Bay Area, from Sacramento —
         There were thousands and thousands and thousands of them. There was —
         nothing that we could do.

Deacon: Okay, alright, I get it. So you bugged out. Who did you bring with you?

O'Brian: NERO personnel, some Feds, people with clearance.

Deacon: That's it? NERO personnel — the soldiers, the guys with guns. The guys
        that should have been protecting the civilians?

O'Brian: There — there's nothing you can do against a Horde. They're too
         strong, they're too fast —

Deacon: I know — I know all about Hordes, O'Brian.

O'Brian: Well then you know that there was nothing that we could do.

Deacon: Oh, you know what you could have done? You could have brought a few of
        them with you. You could have saved a few lives.

O'Brian: There was no hope, there was no time, there was no room, okay? They
         had — they had already turned on each other by the time the Hordes
         arrived.

Deacon: Mm-hmm. I get it. I get it. No, I get it.

O'Brian: Look, I'm sorry about your wife. I'm sorry about all of this. But you
         gotta understand — If you hadn't sent — her with me that night — she
         would've been dead the next morning. You did the right thing. And if
         you had — decided to stay — The only thing that would have happened,
         is you'd be dead right along¹ side her.

Deacon: Don't you think I know that?

        do it.

Boozer: Really? You — you can —
Deacon: Okay¹ boy. Okay¹ easy. It's okay. Alright just, uh, oh Goddammit.

[He puts the wounded dog out of its misery with a knife.]

Boozer: Oh Jesus, Deek. It's okay. It's okay, big guy.
Deacon: Just — that's it, alright. Rest.

[They prepare to kill the dog-hunting Rippers.]

Deacon: You ready?
Boozer: Oh yeah, brother. I'm ready —

[They kill every last one of 'em.]

Deacon: Are you okay —
Boozer: Yeah — I think that's the last of 'em —
Deacon: Oh, you sound — disappointed —
Boozer: Well I just — I hate those sonsofbitches — you know?

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah — yeah — come on. Let's, uh — let's get the hell
        outta here. So what the hell happened back there? You seemed sorta —
        I don't know — like, uh — like you lost it —

Boozer: Uh, I don't know — I guess — I just — I needed some payback for this
        shit — but, uh — there's never gonna be enough payback, is there — you
        know?

Deacon: Yeah.

Boozer: If you hadn't made this shit for me — you know, my arm¹ I mean — I
        don't know where I'd be — I mean — I guess I'd — oh, hell — you know.

Deacon: You gonna be okay?
Boozer: Yeah — not like I got a choice. Not like any of us do, right?
Deacon: Yeah. Okay, come on.
Boozer: Hey, there's your bike — Hey, how'd it go —
Deacon: How'd what go?
Boozer: You know Goddamn well. Your guy in the spacesuit, what'd he say?
Deacon: Oh, it doesn't matter.
Boozer: Hey, c'mon¹ Goddammit.

[He grabs Deacon by the shoulder and is brushed off.]

Deacon: Boozer, you really don't wanna be doin' that right now.

Boozer: Oh yeah? You think I need more than this to take down your scrawny
        little ass? C'mon. What'd he say?

Deacon: Drop it.
Boozer: Seriously, what happened to Sarah? Huh? Where's your old lady, Deek?
Deacon: Where's your old lady —

[Boozer punches him in the gut after dodging Deek's hook.]

Boozer: Huh? Stay down, brother!

[After two more hooks to the face, Deek stays down.]

Boozer: Had enough? Where's your old lady, Deek?
Deacon: She's dead, Boozer. Sarah's dead.

Boozer: Yeah. And she's been dead a long time. So don't you think that you've
        mourned her long enough?

Deacon: Oh God. I think — I think you have a helluva left hook. Asshole.
Boozer: Yeah, it's the only move I got. C'mon¹ man.
Deacon: Fuck. Jesus.
Boozer: I gotta get my sorry ass back to work. Camp ain't gonna feed itself.
Deacon: Okay.

Boozer: It's the only move I got. Still I tagged your ass with it three times
        — in a row!

Deacon: Fuckin' shameful.

[They get back on the road.]

Boozer: Where we headed?
Deacon: Back to camp.

Boozer: Nah, nah, I still gotta work a shift — gimme a ride up there. It's —
        it's just north of Sherman's Camp.

Deacon: Okay.

Boozer: So — she died that night. And there was nothing you, or anyone,
        could've done about it.

Deacon: I shoulda been there —
Boozer: And what good would that've done?
Deacon: Just drop it — it's done. Skizzo, you there? Lost Lake Camp — Skizzo?
Skizzo: Yeah, yeah — what's up?
Deacon: We just had a run¹ in with —

Skizzo: Hey, where the hell is your bro? He skipped work duty today. What the
        hell, man?

Deacon: Would you — just — shut up and listen to me. I was giving him a ride
        to the work site and we were attacked — by Rippers.

Skizzo: Ah Jesus — where?

Deacon: Outside of Rogue Camp. You gotta tell Iron Mike. Carlos is coming —
        and he is not going to stop.

Skizzo: What do you think I've been tellin' him? For months? Yeah, I'll let
        him know.

Deacon: We're headin' toward Tumalo now. Boozer will be at the site in a few
        minutes.

Skizzo: Well that's great, because he owes the camp another half-shift for the
        work he's missed.

Deacon: Shut up, Skizzo.

Skizzo: Hey, Deek? Uh — Rogue Camp is kinda in the opposite direction of
        Tumalo, isn't it?

Deacon: We took the scenic route. Out.
Boozer: Asshole.
Deacon: Oh, Goddamn Skizzo.

[They arrive at the farm in time to see Skizzo's pointless "supervising".]

Skizzo: C'mon, you guys. C'mon, keep workin'. Keep at it. We don't work? We
        don't eat.

Survivor: Alright already —
Skizzo: That's it.
Boozer: Hey. Thanks for the ride.
Skizzo: There you go.

[Afterwards...]

Deacon: St. John to Lost Lake Camp. Come back.

Iron Mike: Deek — I hear ya —

Deacon: Mike, good, look — Boozer and I, uh — we just had a run-in with
        Rippers — they —

Iron Mike: Rippers? Goddammit, you boys crossed the Iron Ridge? Deek, I told
           you —

Deacon: Just listen — no, Mike, they were here! In Rogue Camp —

Iron Mike: Rogue Camp, there were Rippers in Rogue Camp? You sure it was
           Rippers¹ —

Deacon: Am I sure it was — Jesus, Mike. Yeah, they're kinda hard to miss, you
        know, with the scars and acting crazy, killing anything that moves.

Iron Mike: Alright, just calm down. Now, we got to parley with Carlos —
           Skizzo's headin' over to Iron Butte tomorrow. He'll find out what
           the hell's going on, and then we'll —

Deacon: You're sending Skizzo to parley with Carlos. Jesus, Mike.

Iron Mike: Don't tell me how to run my camp, Deek. Like I said, my treaty is
           gonna hold. Lost Lake hold.

Deacon: Hell — whatever you say, Mike — whatever you say. Skizzo's right —
        you're gonna get everyone killed.

[After the news about Sarah, Deek rides out.]

Boozer: Deek — where you at, brother?
Deacon: Hey, Boozer. I'm, uh — I'm heading up to Marion Forks.
Boozer: Marion Forks? What the hell for?

Deacon: Because I decided — hell, it's like you said. I've, uh — I've mourned
        her long enough. It's¹ um — time to say goodbye.

Boozer: You headin' to the church?
Deacon: I don't know, yeah, maybe.
Boozer: Jesus¹ Deek.
Deacon: It's the last time, Boozer. I swear. Deacon out.

[En route to Marion Forks...]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. What does
          NERO want? They disappear for two years, come back guns blazin'.
          Don't bother trying to find out. You'll get yourself killed. Besides,
          we already know. I been watchin' them skulk around, thinkin' they
          know these woods better than me. They're doin' something with the
          Freaks — trackin' em¹, studyin' em¹, watchin' em¹. Making notes in
          their little notebooks. And you know why? They're gathering info,
          seeing how long it takes for these sonsofbitches to die or starve
          off. Probably tryin' to get a read on when the Feds can re-emerge
          from their hidey-holes and crawl back into their unjust positions of
          power. For once, the Freaks are on our side. Longer they're here,
          longer the Feds can rot down there in their stony prison. The world
          may not be ours anymore, but thanks to the Freaks, it doesn't belong
          to the Feds either. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon.
          Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Once again — Cope — you don't know shit. Freaks ain't on anybody's
        side — and the world? It already belongs to them.

[Eventually, he reaches the Marion Forks church. He sees squatters inside,
 breaking and kicking over the pews.]

Deacon: What the fuck?

[He starts taking them out.]

Deacon: Not to Sarah's church — Hey — your friends are all dead — why don't ya
        come on out here and help me pray for 'em —

[He kills the other two. After, he has a flashback to his wedding day.]

Minister: Uh, you've — you've each prepared your own vows? Well — uh —
          traditionally, the — the groom goes first.

Deacon: Uh —

Sarah: I'll — I'll go first. Deacon, I'm so sorry that no one came. I guess we
       really pissed off everyone. On both sides.

Deacon: Well, I mean not — everyone.

Sarah: But I want you to know that that's how much you mean to me. That I would
       give up anything for you. Anything. This ring is a symbol of my love.
       And it is precious. It has no beginning and no end. I love you.

[His flashback suddenly ends as Deacon, in the present, hears bikes ride up.]

Deacon: Shit — more of 'em — You hear me? Stay out —

[When he kills the reinforcements, he drifts back in time to his wedding vows.]

Deacon: Um — This ring is my promise — That I'm always gonna love you — And I
        ain't ever gonna leave you.

Minister: You — you may — kiss the bride.
Deacon: Yeah —
Sarah: Oh, wait a — wait a second. Here, you can have this one back —

[She returns his Mongrels ring.]

Sarah: But only if you promise to ride me as much as you ride your bike.

[They start making out.]

Minister: Well, I now pronounce you — man and, well, wife. Okay — I'm gonna
          just go.

[Boozer, the only one in attendance, slow-claps for his bro.]

Deacon: Get a room!

[As the flashback ends, Deek walks outside.]

Deacon: Don't worry. This is never gonna happen again.

[He tosses a molotov into the church, setting it ablaze. In the morning, it's
 just a husk of its former self.]

Deacon: Boozeman, you there?
Boozer: Yeah¹ Deek — what's up¹ —

Deacon: You remember that little church, the one Sarah and I got married in?
        Well, I found a couple of assholes trashin' the place —

Boozer: Wish I'd been there. I'da helped you kill 'em all. Messin' with Sarah's
        church. Shit.

Deacon: Yeah. Anyway — just checkin' in. Deacon out.

Deacon: Addy, you there? Lost Lake infirmary, can you read me?
Addy: Deacon? I'm here.

Deacon: Addy, good, good. Look, um — are you gonna be around for awhile? I,
        uh — I — I need to see you.

Addy: Is everything okay? What's wrong?
Deacon: Uh, look, nothing. I'm — I'll tell you when I get there. Deacon out.

Addy: Well, I told you that it was going to be a big adjustment.

Addy: No. Sorry.
Deacon: Okay.

Addy: Wait. I heard about what happened. How he went after those guys, who
      were killing those dogs?

Deacon: Yeah — and he nearly got us killed while doin' it.
Addy: Well, maybe that's your answer.
Deacon: Nearly getting us killed while doin' it?

Addy: Look, what does William love so much that he'd be willing to risk his

[After a long wait, Deek returns to Lost Lake to help fix a transformer.]

Deacon: You got what you need?
Rikki: Yep, everything I could think of. Let's go.
Deacon: Well, you sound pretty excited.
Rikki: It's the candle, Deek.
Deacon: What?

Rikki: The old saying — "It's better to light one candle, than curse the
       darkness." We've spent the last two years doing a whole lotta cursing.
       We get the lights on at Lost Lake and — that's lighting our first
       candle.

Deacon: Yeah — only one problem with that.
Rikki: And what's that, Deek?

Deacon: Lights attract all kinds of nasty bugs, and they make it way easier
        for 'em to find you. Hey, we're here.

[They dismount at the gas station.]

Deacon: Shit. Swarmers.
Rikki: I was hoping it was going to be clear.
Deacon: Nah — why would he have that kind of luck.¹

[Deacon takes out the Swarmers.]

Deacon: Huh — okay — I think that's all of 'em —
Rikki: Crap — Okay, to fix this thing, I gotta climb up there.
Deacon: Have you done this before?
Rikki: Nope. But there's a first time for everything, right?
Deacon: Right.
Rikki: Okay, c'mon, boost me up. Alright, ready?
Deacon: Uh-huh.
Rikki: One — two — three —
Deacon: If you fall — it ain't like I can catch ya —
Rikki: Gee, thanks. I'll try to keep that in mind. Shit — Newts!
Deacon: I got 'em —
Rikki: Deek?!
Deacon: I'm tryin' —
Rikki: Goddammit — where the hell are they coming from?
Deacon: Shit — everywhere. Hold on!

[Deacon shoots all the attacking Newts.]

Rikki: All done. I'm coming down.
Deacon: Well Goddammit —
Rikki: Well, that was fun.
Deacon: Yeah, we're gonna have to come out and do this again sometime.

Rikki: Yeah, I'll talk to Skizzo about getting some barbed wire around this.
       It'll keep the Newts off.

Deacon: Yeah, sounds like the kind of shit job he likes to give me.
Rikki: You'll live. C'mon, I gotta check something else out.

[They start riding again.]

Rikki: So, your ol' lady?
Deacon: Okay, how the hell did —

Rikki: It's not hard to put two and two together, Deek. How you lost her at
       that refugee camp — the one north of Belknap — And then in the last few
       weeks we see NERO choppers in the air — and you were hoping for, what?
       A miracle? That she was with them somehow?

Deacon: Something like that —
Rikki: But she's not.
Deacon: No.
Rikki: I'm sorry —
Deacon: Look, it's not a big deal, so let's just drop it.
Rikki: Okay.

[They return to Lost Lake. Soon, a crowd is near the lodge's generator.]

Deacon: Wow, word gets around.

Rikki: I'm almost ready. Power to the whole resort is routed through here. I
       pulled the breaker a week ago so it wouldn't short out. Okay. Ready
       when you are.

Iron Mike: Alright! Let's listen up! Okay. Now the past few months have been
           tough, not gonna deny that. We're low on food, medicine, hell,
           pretty much everything. But we got one thing in spades, and without
           that, everything else is meaningless. That one thing — is trust.
           Now a while ago we had some more Drifters ride into camp. Some a'
           you said kick 'em out, we ain't got enough for ourselves. Some a'
           you said we can't trust 'em. Tonight — is proof of what I've been
           saying all along. We need everyone — I mean everyone — Who is
           willing to be here, who is willing to work, who is willing to help
           us rebuild. Now for the past coupla months, Rikki has been doin'
           just that. But she can't do it alone. She needs help. Tonight is
           gonna happen because we welcomed a Drifter into our camp. And we
           allowed him to earn our trust. Tonight we take one more step out of
           the darkness.

[Rikki flips the breaker and the town lights come on. She and Mike hug.]

Iron Mike: C'mere. C'mere. Thank you! Thank you! Oh my God! Hey, hey! Hey¹ you
           two, I gotta — I gotta — I got a bottle a' bourbon inside. C'mon,

Deacon: Uh, it's nothin'.
Rikki: Mm-hmm. C'mon, let's go see Addy.

[They walk to the infirmary.]

Rikki: So the woman in the photo, that was her?
Deacon: That was my wife, yeah.
Rikki: Uh — dumb question¹ I'm — I'm sorry, Deek.
Deacon: No, don't be. She's, uh — she's been dead a long time.

Rikki: Still, it can't be easy, to get your hopes up like that only to — I —
       I don't know. I wish — there was something I could do.

Deacon: Well there is.
Rikki: What?
Deacon: Stop talkin' about it.
Rikki: Okay.

[The clinic seems deserted.]

Rikki: Addy? Addy? Well, the lights are up.

Deacon: I don't think she's here.

Rikki: Addy, you here? Okay, well — strip.

Deacon: Strip — strip what?

Rikki: Take your shirt off, sit on the table.

Deacon: Hey, look, it's nothin'.

Rikki: Deacon. Do you want an infection? Mm-hmm. I may be an engineer, Deek,
       but — That does not mean — aha! — that I don't know how to treat a cut.

Deacon: Yeah, never woulda guessed, the way that you were caressing those —
        switches and circuits or whatever the hell you were doin'.

Rikki: Alright, this? Might hurt. Just — a little bit. Ready? Okay.

Deacon: Ah Jesus! okay¹ —

Rikki: Really?

Deacon: No, why don't we just wait for Addy to come back? Huh?

Rikki: Just — shh. Hang on. There, it's done. Big baby.

Deacon: See, I told you it was nothin'.

Rikki: Yeah, you did.

[They just stare at each other, sharing a moment, before looking away.]

Rikki: Oh wow. You really have been at war.

Deacon: Yeah, more than one.

Rikki: Shit, that's right? Where was this one? Afghanistan or the MC? Or after?

Deacon: I, uh, I — I don't remember.

Rikki: What about this one?

Deacon: Rikki, uh. I'm not sure that, um — Well, I hear that Addy doesn't
        really like, um — People messing around in her business.

Rikki: Yeah, I — I heard that too. What about this one?

Deacon: Rikki.

[Skizzo can be seen eavesdropping on their convo, then leaving.]

Rikki: Deek, I'm not married. Hmm. Okay. Why don't you come back tomorrow, and
       see Addy, and she's gonna tell you how great of a job I did.

Deacon: Rikki, um —

Rikki: Deek, it's — it's — it's fine. You're welcome. Hey, Deacon? Maybe one
       day, stop and light a candle. It can get pretty dark and cold out there.

Addy: Well I'm glad! You know, you're a good friend to him. He's lucky to have
      you.

[Awhile after that...]

Boozer: Deek, ya there?

Deacon: Yeah¹ Boozeman, what's up?

Boozer: I just — I just wanted to say thanks — for — the dog.

Deacon: It's no worries, brother. I mean it — it followed me, y'know. Wouldn't
        leave me alone. What was I supposed to do?

Boozer: Hey, hey — get down, hey — c'mon — easy — yeah, sure it followed you.
        Hey, uh — I named him Jack.

Deacon: Yeah, Jack would have loved that.

Boozer: Uh, no. He wouldn't have — which is why I did it. Alright, easy — easy,
        boy. Alright, alright — enough, enough! Okay, Deek, I gotta go — Boozer
        out.

Deacon: You're welcome.

Skizzo: Hey¹ Deek, ya — ya there? I need you to meet me —
Deacon: I'm here¹ Skizzo — whaddya want? I'm busy —

Skizzo: Look, I — I know you're tryin' to help the camp — and — I'm tryin' to help you, help the camp — meet me at the back of the lodge — Skizzo
        out.

Deacon: Dammit¹ Skizzo — this better be good —

[Up at the lodge, 

Deacon: Alright, I'm here. What do you want?
Skizzo: Hold on. C'mon. In here.
Deacon: Skizzo, what's goin' on?
Skizzo: Well if you go inside, I'll show you.

[They enter the lodge basement where the TNT is kept.]

Skizzo: Hey, I've been thinkin' about your idea. You know the one where you —
        Wanna seal the cave north of the camp to cut down on the Hordes passing
        through our farm area?

Deacon: Okay.

Skizzo: Problem is, Iron Mike hasn't been able to find any det cord for this,
        has he?

Deacon: No.
Skizzo: But I know where you can get some. Right here.

[A map location is circled in Iron Butte territory.]

Deacon: No way. No.
Skizzo: I know what you're thinkin'. I get it, okay.

Deacon: No, that's in the middle of Ripper territory. Last time I went through
        there —

Skizzo: You got meds that saved your boy's life.
Deacon: No!
Skizzo: We get the det cord, we blow the cave — boom — goodbye Horde.
Deacon: Uh-huh.
Skizzo: It was your Goddamn idea.

Deacon: Look, they have sealed the Goddamn border, they sealed the tunnel. If
        I go through there? I'm startin' a war, Skizzo.

Skizzo: I've got a plan. Besides, I'm goin' with you. Keep your ass outta
        trouble. Just grab as much gear as you can. Hopefully, we won't need
        it, but you never know. And then meet me — here. 'Cause there's a trail
        that goes over Iron Ridge.

Deacon: What? The fuck are you talkin' about?
Skizzo: Right there. Just trust me.
Deacon: Jesus.
Skizzo: You in? I'll see you there.

[Deacon hits the road.]

Deacon: Skizzo, I'm ready.
Skizzo: You comin'? Remember where we're meetin', west of Melakwa Lake.
Deacon: Yeah. I'll be there.

[A little while after...]

Rikki: Deek — this is Lost Lake. You out there?
Deacon: Uh — hey¹ Rikki —

Rikki: I've been looking for you — finally got power back on to most of the
       camp — including my cabin —

Deacon: Great — hey, I'm, uh —

Rikki: I even found an old water heater that works — guess I'm gonna get my
       hot shower, yeah?

Deacon: Great, great —
Rikki: Hey — where are you?

Deacon: Look, uh — Skizzo and I — we're — we're gonna get the det cord for

Deacon: Uh, Rikki — hey — you're cuttin' out — I can't hear ya — I'll talk to
        you — just as soon as we get back.

[Deek rendezvous with Skizzo.]

Skizzo: Hey.
Deacon: What are you doin'?
Skizzo: What we're gonna do, is go in through their Goddamned back door.
Deacon: On foot? You never told me we were goin' on foot.

Skizzo: Remember what happened the last time you took your noisy-ass bike in
        there?

Deacon: Good point.
Skizzo: Hey. They'll never even see us.
Deacon: So, uh — Iron Mike said that he sent you to "parley" with Carlos?

Skizzo: Wait, the old man told you that? Yeah, yeah, sure, sure — okay, I guess
        there's no harm in you bein' in the know — seein' as how you and your
        bro are part of the camp now.

Deacon: Well, it must have gone well, seeing as how we're just going in through
        — what, what'd you call it? Their Goddamn back door?

Skizzo: The meet and greet? Oh, yeah, it went swell — like tryin' to negotiate
        with a barrel of monkeys all whacked out on PCP. But you know what?
        Long as we don't get caught tonight? The old man's treaty might just
        hold after all.

Deacon: Even though Boozer and I just had a run¹ in with 'em at Rogue Camp.

Skizzo: Hey, Carlos said that was a mistake — some rogue Rippers — get it? Heh
        — anyway, he said it wouldn't happen again.

Deacon: And you believe him.
Skizzo: What the hell do I know? I'm just one of Mike's flunkies, same as you.

[They travel into a long-forgotten mountain trail.]

Skizzo: Shit — you hear that?
Deacon: Yeah. Wolves —
Skizzo: You think they're infected?
Deacon: Guess we're gonna find out. How'd you get through before?

Skizzo: There used to be a — an old wooden ladder, left by miners — or
        spelunkers — or some shit. Come on — over here. Boost me up. You ready?

Deacon: Yeah.
Skizzo: Go — Got it —

Deacon: Look around down there, see if that ladder's there somewhere — I'll
        take a look up here.

Deacon: Okay — hurry it up. We gotta be in and out of Ripper territory before
        it gets light —

Skizzo: Yeah? Tell me somethin' I don't know — Wolves — look out!

Deacon: I got 'em —

[Deek clears out the attacking wolfpack.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em — Skizzo? Skizzo, where the hell are you?
Skizzo: Hold on, hold on, I got it — Watch your head —
Deacon: Got it —

[Deacon ascends the ladder into Ripper territory.]

Skizzo: I found a map in Mike's papers — showin' some of these old Forest
        Service trails.

Deacon: I'm sure Iron Mike loves you rifling through his shit.
Skizzo: What the old man doesn't know won't hurt him.
Deacon: Sure.

Skizzo: Anyway, you can see the trail's in bad shape,¹ it was marked on the
        map as closed.

[They drop down onto a hillside overlooking a farm with crazy Rippers dancing.]

Skizzo: You see that?
Deacon: Yeah — a Ripper bonfire.
Skizzo: You ever seen one before?
Deacon: No —

Skizzo: They call it a "Gathering" — heard they do all kinda messed up crap —
        let's go around — I don't want any part of that —

Deacon: Hell with that — I wanna see it —
Skizzo: What, you got a death wish?

Deacon: Not anymore — look, I just — I wanna see for myself what these assholes
        go through, you know — "Rest in Peace" — "get low" — all that shit —

[They creep near the bonfire where crazies dance in a twisted reverie.]

Deacon: Wait, hold up — What the fuck?

Skizzo: They're cuttin' themselves. Yeah. Had a guy who went through one of
        their rituals, or whatever-the-fuck. He said the Rippers are jacked up
        on something — some PCP or somethin'. They don't feel the pain.

Deacon: Well, let's go around.

Skizzo: Just what I was thinkin'. You ever see anything like that before?

Deacon: No. Not like that.

Skizzo: Me either. That's why we gotta keep our heads down. We get caught out
        here, there ain't enough bullets to take 'em down —

Skizzo: It's me!

Deacon: Wait, you're sure this is the right way?

Skizzo: Yeah, why?

Deacon: I used to ride through here, back in the day.

Skizzo: What?

Deacon: My ol' lady used to work out here — there was a research lab, east of
        Iron Butte Lodge. Anyway, I'd ride out here — I swear the
        transportation complex is back that way.

Skizzo: Let's just keep goin' — you'll see. It's this way.

[They pass through some dips and coulees.]

Skizzo: What the fuck is that?
Deacon: Rippers. They use air horns to attract Freaks. Come on.

[They see a gathering near a dirt road - a hostage and some airhorn-blowers.]

Skizzo: Oh shit. What the fuck?
Deacon: Shit.
Skizzo: Goddammit.
Deacon: Okay —
Skizzo: No, no. Leave 'em, leave 'em. We are not here to start a war.
Deacon: Gimme a second. Gimme a second.

Sigil Victim: Somebody! Someone, please —
Skizzo: Come on. C'mon, we gotta go.
Sigil Victim: Please help me!
Deacon: No, no, no. We're not leavin' her to the Freaks.

Deacon: Skizzo, we are not leaving her.
Skizzo: This is not why were are here. Shit. Yeah, okay. Okay.

Skizzo: I got her. I got her. Shh shh shh shh — Her legs are broken. She ain't
        goin' anywhere, bro. We gotta get a move on. Just do it.

        gonna be okay. It's okay¹ sweetheart.

 with a blowtorch.]

Carlos: Do you know who I am?
Deacon: No. I thought Rippers don't have names.

Carlos: We are on the Path. My followers — My followers have all given up their

Carlos: I kept my name. And I kept my memories. Of how you and Boozer and

Carlos: Until nothing remains — but your name. That's what the Freaks are, you
        know. I learned that too. That's why we need to be just like them.

Deacon: Okay. We gonna do this, or are you gonna talk me to death?

Lisa: It is you. I saw them bring you in.
Deacon: Lisa?

Lisa: No. That is not my name. I'm on the Path. I don't have a name anymore.
      None of us do. Everyone I ever cared about — is dead.

Deacon: Lisa. Listen to me —
Lisa: Do you know why we want to be like them? Like the Freaks?
Deacon: No.

[She raises her knife —— and cuts the rope binding his arm.]

Lisa: It's because they don't remember what they've lost. Who — they've lost.

[She tosses the knife near his feet and leaves. Deacon frees himself and then
 does the same, leading right into the Rippers' temple.]

Deacon: Lisa? Lisa? She's gone — I can't let them see me — If they see me,
        they're gonna bring the whole place down on my head —

[He sneaks around, murdering Rippers he finds as quietly as possible.]

Deacon: I'll enlighten you — Oh, give me a chance — I'll help you find the
        Path — One Mind, yeah — right — Find out where they're keepin' my
        shit — Get my gear — Bonfire — where the hell is the Bonfire — It's a

        just drag people in here, fuck with 'em, steal their shit — And then
        what, take it all and throw it in the bonfire out there? Is that the
        idea? Jesus Christ. Oh, hello. Yeah. Got another question for you.

Deacon: My cut — my leather jacket — my fucking leather jacket. Who took it?

Ripper: Don't know.

Deacon: Okay —

Ripper: Wait, wait, wait! He just left! He just took it and left, not long ago!

[She gives Deacon a hug.]

Deacon: Alright, listen. Run as fast as you can. Stay off the roads. Keep
        moving no matter what. Go.

[Lisa escapes and Deacon follow suit soon after.]

Deacon: Boozer — you there? Boozer, if you can hear me — look — it's Skizzo —
        he sold me out — The Rippers — Boozer, they're coming. Warn Iron Mike —

[Deek cuts through the countryside, dodging Ripper patrols.]

Deacon: I gotta get back to my bike — I gotta find that trail — It was by that
        house — with the bonfire —

[After much backtracking, Deacon finds Skizzo's forest trail.]

Deacon: This is it — I shoulda never let Skizzo talk me into that shit — I am
        such an idiot — shoulda seen it coming — How the hell did I let Skizzo
        get the drop on me? And Goddamn Jessie Williamson — "Carlos" — low
        life piece of shit. Jack shoulda done more than burn your tat off,
        Jessie — shoulda slit your Goddamn throat — Almost there — Boozer —
        Lost Lake Camp — come in. Skizzo's on his way — with Rippers. Do you
        read me? Does anybody read me? Goddammit — Lost Lake? Dammit! There —
        there — it's still there —

[Deek finally makes it back to his bike.]

Deacon: Boozer? You there? Rikki? Lost Lake Camp. Is anyone there?
Rikki: Deacon —
Deacon: Yeah, it's me. Wait, hold on!
Rikki: Deacon — Mike sent riders to find you —
Deacon: Rikki, the Rippers are after Boozer —
Rikki: Deek? No, no, no, no, no —

[Rikki's radio cuts out. Meanwhile, friendly riders pull up alongside Deek as
 the area is crawling with bike-riding Rippers.]

Guard: Hey, hey — don't shoot — it's Deacon! Iron Mike sent us to find you —
Guard: Rippers!

Deacon: Keep goin'! I'll keep 'em off ya — We need to get back to the camp —
        don't worry, I got this —

Guard: More of 'em —
Deacon: No, no, no! Don't stop! Keep going! We're almost there —

Deacon: Go around it — don't stop, you got that? We're nearly there — you guys

        off here, I'm gonna go in on the foot bridge, across the marsh — If you

[Deek crosses into Iron Lake via the footbridge, just as he said. Rippers are
 attacking the camp with their usual cruel methods.]

Ripper: Get low!

[Deek slits a throat of someone slicing up a woman.]

Survivor: No — no more cutting! Please! Please, please, please!

Deacon: Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey! Shh, shh — It's okay, I'm
        not gonna hurt you. C'mon — C'mon —

        look at me.

Survivor: Yeah —
Deacon: I'm lookin' for Boozer and Skizzo. Do you know them?
Survivor: I don't, I — I don't — I don't know — I mean —
Deacon: Do you know where they are?

Survivor: Everything it just — just happened so, so fast. They — they were —
          they were everywhere — they, the Rippers — they were — All over the —
          the camp and they were torturing us, they —

Deacon: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Survivor: They took me. They — they took Jen, and Eric, and Blake. Oh God!
Deacon: Hey¹ listen, what's your name?
Survivor: Nicole.
Deacon: Nicole, do you know how to use a gun?
Survivor: Yeah —
Deacon: Good.
Survivor: Yeah.

Deacon: Okay, you see that tower up there, I want you to go up there, I want
        you to lay down — If any Rippers come through here, you blow their
        Goddamn heads off. I'm gonna go find your friends. Okay? Go.

Survivor: Okay. Okay.

[Deacon starts taking out nearby Rippers who're torching buildings.]

Deacon: I am not letting these assholes kill any more of my people — Rest in
        Peace —

[Deek kills a Ripper holding a woman hostage.]

Hostage: Sonofabitch — Thank you.

Deacon: Quiet — no time for that now — You guys know Nicole — right? Alright,
        listen to me — head west, to the foot bridge — she's up in the watch
        tower — you go there, you help her — now, I don't want any more
        Rippers comin' in through the marsh, you got it?

Hostage: You're a godsend — I was praying so hard.
Deacon: Good. Then go — go!
Hostage: Thank you.

Deacon: Alright¹ Nicole — I did my part, now you do yours — Boozer? Boozer —
        Rikki? Anyone?

Rikki: Deek, I thought I lost you.
Deacon: Rikki — where's Boozer? Where's Skizzo?
Rikki: I don't know what's going on. I saw Skizzo with Boozer —
Deacon: Where? Where, Rikki?
Rikki: I — Deek — Rippers — they're breaking into the infirmary — dammit —
Deacon: Hold on — I'm heading there now — wait for me —
Rikki: Deacon?? Addy — no!
Deacon: Oh, dammit — Rikki —

[Her radio goes silent.]

Deacon: I gotta get to the infirmary. She'll know where Boozer is — There is
        is —

[He battles to the infirmary's lawn. A Ripper has Addy at knifepoint.]

Rikki: Don't. Let her go.
Addy: Please. Don't.
Ripper: You're all Lost. Lost!

[Deacon aims his shotgun at the Ripper's head.]

Rikki: No, no, no — no!

[An airhorn blares afterwards and the Rippers stop their fighting.]

Survivor: Ceasefire!
Rikki: I thought you were gonna stay inside.
Addy: I — I heard someone yelling, I just — I just couldn't let 'em die.
Deacon: Wait, wait, wait, wait — hold up. Hold up. What the hell was that?
Survivor: It's over! Yeah, Iron Mike negotiated a ceasefire.
Rikki: Wait, what? What the hell is going on?
Deacon: Let's go find out.
Rikki: You okay? C'mon.
Addy: I'm sorry. About everything.
Rikki: Oh God, me too.

[Up at the Lodge, Mike, Skizzo, Carlos and some fighters are in the main room.
 Boozer is captured with duct tape on his mouth.]

Skizzo: Mike, this is just a big misunderstanding. They only want —

Iron Mike: They attack my camp, murdered my people, you call that a
           misunderstanding?

Carlos: You broke our treaty. You come onto our land. You steal our supplies.
        You attack and kill my people!

Iron Mike: Which we had a deal to share. You lyin' sonofabitch!
Skizzo: Mike, listen to me. I made a deal.

[Deacon creeps into the room and takes Skizzo at knifepoint.]

Iron Mike: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa — weapons down! Weapons down!
Carlos: Get low, brothers! Get low. Hold.
Skizzo: Jesus.
Deacon: Alright, Skizzo, I'd like to hear about that deal.
Skizzo: Goddammit, just wait.
Deacon: Why don't you tell him? Tell him how you sold us out to them?
Skizzo: What the hell do you want me to —

Deacon: Oh fuckin' Goddammit, Skizzo, why don't you tell him or I'm gonna cut
        your throat.

Skizzo: Okay. Okay! I made a deal with Carlos, okay? Mike? But it wasn't — It
        wasn't to sell out the camp, I swear, it was just them, the two of
        them. Him and Boozer — That's all he wants. Just them.

Boozer: You sonofabitch —
Deacon: Yeah? How's the deal workin' out for ya?

Skizzo: I did it to save the camp, Mike, I did it to fix shit. To restore the
        treaty he broke. Mike.

Iron Mike: Deek — It's good to see you breathin'. But let him go. Deek!

[He reluctantly frees Skizzo.]

Iron Mike: Okay, okay, so — Is what he says true? About you making a deal?
Carlos: Only Lost tell lies. Yeah, it's true.

Iron Mike: Okay. So we give you Deek, William — biker boys, whatever the fuck
           you wanna call 'em. But you leave Lost Lake alone.

Carlos: You will Rest in Peace. You have my word.

Iron Mike: And that's somethin', isn't it? Your word. Grand-fuckin'-poobah of
           the R.I.P.

[Mike pulls a gun on Carlos, bringing the tension back up again.]

Carlos: Hey, hey. We come here under a flag of truce.

Iron Mike: Truce¹ my ass. This is my camp. My people. You don't come here with
           some bloodstained flag of truce and demand shit — not from me. Now
           I don't care what you think these boys have done. I don't care why
           you want 'em. All I know is you're not gettin' 'em.

Skizzo: Mike, please.
Carlos: We had a deal.

Iron Mike: No, this is the deal, Carlos. And it's the only one you're gettin'.
           Now you take your people and you get the hell outta Lost Lake — Or
           we all die together — right here, right now.

Carlos: Our treaty stands?
Iron Mike: Always has, from where I'm standin'.
Boozer: You sonofabitch!

[Boozer, now sans gag, lunges at Skizzo.]

Iron Mike: Boozer! Alright, escort them outta my fucking camp.

[Carlos and his men turn to leave.]

Deacon: Hey, uh, we ain't through, Carlos.
Carlos: Get low, brother.
Iron Mike: Deek. Stand aside. Stand aside!
Skizzo: Mike, look, I — I just want to say —

[Mike gives him a mean right hook.]

Iron Mike: Take him to lockup.
Deacon: Nah, fuck that, we'll take care —

Iron Mike: Get off him! I keep trying to tell you boys something, and you won't
           listen. This is not how we do things around here. We do not barter
           with lives and we do not murder people in cold blood. Get him outta
           here.

Skizzo: Get off me.

Iron Mike: We're gonna give him a fair trial, like civilized people. And he's
           gonna get what's comin' to him.

Skizzo: I'm — not sorry, Mike. I'm not. Goddammit, I tried — I tried to save
        this camp. The Rippers won't stop. Carlos is not gonna stop. You hear
        me, they won't stop!

[After the hostilities are over, Boozer and Deacon walk out.]

Boozer: You know who that was?
Deacon: Jessie.
Boozer: Mm-hmm.

Deacon: Yeah, I guess being a cult leader at the end of the world wasn't enough
        to keep him busy. He was after some payback as well.

[Deacon shows his burned, blistered arm.]

Boozer: That motherfuckin' sonofabitch.

Deacon: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm guessing he's known about us for quite some time.
        That night at Crazy Willie's? That wasn't some random Ripper attack.

Boozer: And Skizzo was gonna sell us out to him? Where'd they take him? I'm
        gonna find him and break his fuckin' neck.

Deacon: No. Hold up. Leave Skizzo for right now. Get your gear together, some
        Molotovs, all the ammunition you can carry.

Boozer: Wait, what're you thinkin'? And I already know it's a bad idea —

Deacon: Yeah, it's a bad idea. But we're gonna do it anyway. I need to go and
        get the explosives from the lodge and that det cord from Skizzo's
        cabin. Meet me at the bridge. I'll explain on the way. Hey, you good
        with this, brother?

Boozer: Yeah, oh yeah.

[Boozer leaves to shore up ammo, etc.]

Rikki: Deek? You there? Deacon, come in.
Deacon: Yeah, Rikki — I'm here — hey, listen — I don't have time —
Rikki: What the hell happened? I just saw them locking Skizzo up and I —
Deacon: Yeah? Good — now, I don't have time to talk —

Rikki: And Carlos and all the Rippers just rode out — after everything they
       did —

Deacon: Yeah? Okay, great. Talk to Iron Mike about that bullshit —
Rikki: I will — but I need to talk to you. I don't — want you doing anything —
Deacon: Look¹ Rikki, you are talkin' to me —
Rikki: Face to face, Deek. It's important —
Deacon: It's always important — Rikki, look, I gotta go —
Rikki: Deacon, wait —
Deacon: Sorry, Rikki — we're gonna talk again later. Alright? Deacon out.

[Later, if Deacon is riding around:]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. The War on
          Terror. Global warming. None of that matters now that we're in The
          Shit. But it's all just part of the Goddamn conspiracy — so listen
          up. The War on Terror was just smoke and mirrors, started by good old
          Uncle Sam, usin' war as an excuse to look for weapons of mass
          destruction that didn't exist. And global warming? Just a buncha
          lying scientists well in the pockets of those gunnin' to profit off
          of all the doom and gloom. When you think about it — all of this?
          Just another way to build unrest in the people. If we're too busy
          arguing about polar ice caps and genetically altered food and jihad,
          then we're blind to what's really going on behind the curtain. Don't
          be fooled by all their misdirection, folks. They point one way? You
          look straight at 'em. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon.
          Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: So your sage advice, Cope, is to assume that everyone's just lyin'
        their ass off, is that about it? So — Jesus — that's, uh — that's
        actually pretty good advice for once — a little late — but it's good
        advice.

Addy: I — I can't do this anymore.

Addy: I'm a Goddamned veteranarian. I went to school to cure colic and heaves
      and hoof diseases. Does this look like a fucking hoof to you?

Deacon: Addy. Addy.
Addy: No, you saw what happened to Boozer. I can't do this.
Deacon: Hey, shh — Addy! Addy. Addy.

Addy: There are just so many wounded, and so many dying. Deacon, I am not a

[Deek returns to his house and starts preparing the TNT. Rikki comes over.]

Rikki: Hey¹ Deek. So I went to go check on the explosives — To make sure,
       y'know, the Rippers didn't steal them. And then I went to Skizzo's
       cabin — To check on the det cords. But I shoulda just come straight
       here and saved some time.

Deacon: Get the hell outta here, Rikki —

Rikki: Guess we can go blow up that cave, right? I'll come with you.

Deacon: When I was a kid — My dad found a rat's nest underneath one of our
        sheds. You want to know what he did?

Rikki: Can't even guess.

Deacon: Well he waited 'til morning, when they'd all be asleep, he laid a piece
        of plywood over the hole, and told me to go get the garden hose. And he
        said to me — I'll never forget what he said to me — he said, the best
        way to kill a rat's nest is to drown 'em.

Rikki: You're gonna — blow up the reservoir above the camp?
Deacon: Now that's an idea.
Rikki: Deacon, you can't do —
Deacon: They wanna Rest in Peace? I'm gonna help 'em out.
Rikki: Deacon, you can't do that.

Deacon: Why is that? 'Cause of Iron Mike? Because of some fuckin' treaty? You
        know I wanna cut Skizzo's throat, but he's right about one thing —
        Carlos ain't gonna stop. Rippers ain't gonna stop. And you know it.

Rikki: Are you sure this isn't personal?
Deacon: Fuck yeah it's personal.
Rikki: Okay.

[She leaves.]

Deacon: Boozer, I'm heading to the gate. You ready?
Boozer: Way ahead of ya, brother.
Deacon: Okay, I'm almost there.

[Deek heads to his bike; Boozer's already there.]

Boozer: Nice rifle.
Deacon: Oh yeah. A little present from Skizzo.
Boozer: Remind me to be there when you give it back to him.
Deacon: Oh, you'll be there.

[They set out for Ripper territory.]

Deacon: Oh goddamn, Skizzo —

Boozer: So what're we gonna do with the bastard? I mean, we're not lettin' Iron
        Mike put him on trial, are we?

Deacon: No, we're not.

Boozer: Alright, so what's the plan?

Deacon: I know the area pretty well. Sarah, uh — she worked out of a lab south
        of Iron Butte Ranch. I used to ride out there, pick her up for lunch.
        Taught her¹ ride on some of those back roads. Jessie — Carlos —
        whatever he's calling himself — he's taken over the old golf course and
        resort. Just south of the lodge is the Crescent Lake reservoir. Now, we
        blow that dam, that lake's gonna flood down into the valley and it's
        gonna drown 'em all — like rats.

Boozer: Okay, but isn't the lodge up on a hill?

Deacon: Yeah, yeah — flood probably won't do much to it, but it'll do enough
        damage to the rest of the Ripper compound and take out most of his men.

Boozer: And if Jessie survives, he won't see us coming.
Deacon: You got it.

Boozer: Now we just gotta figure out how to get into the Iron Butte valley
        without being seen, yeah?

Deacon: I'll get us there. You just hang on.

[They head to the border tunnel near Rogue Camp, which is filled with foes.]

Boozer: Ripper Patrol!
Deacon: I see 'em —

Boozer: C'mon — you damn Rippers — Yeah — you see what you did to my arm? This
        is for you — More Rippers!

Deacon: I got 'em!

[They kill all the psychos.]

Boozer: You okay?
Deacon: I've been better —
Boozer: Alright¹ come on — we've gotta finish this —
Deacon: Right — behind you. We gotta head south from here —
Boozer: Followin' you.

[They reach the reservoir by nightfall.]

Deacon: They ain't gonna make this easy.
Boozer: Nope.
Deacon: Okay — Hey, what are you doin'?

Boozer: Figured I'd take this bag of explosives down there — And ask 'em if
        they didn't mind us, y'know, blowin' 'em the fuck up.

Deacon: Boozer —

Boozer: Look. You stay up here with Skizzo's rifle and keep 'em off me while I
        set the charges.

Boozer: Look, I got this. I'm not much good in a firefight, but I can plant

        goin' up, and me with it —

Deacon: Hey, I got this — you just get the charges planted.
Boozer: And I'm — setting the second charge — Got it —

[As Boozer descends, more Rippers ride in.]

Boozer: Kinda busy here — you got 'em?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah —
Boozer: Huh — a few less Rippers — nice work —
Deacon: Keep — goin', Boozer — c'mon — c'mon —
Boozer: Deek? Deek — more Rippers —
Deacon: I see 'em —
Boozer: Where do I set the next charge?
Deacon: Rikki called it the penstock, the big pipe, at the base of the dam.
Boozer: Okay — headin' there now — Alright — third charge — In position —
Deacon: Just — move your ass —
Boozer: Okay, you try doin' this with one hand and a blade —
Deacon: Hey, c'mon¹ man, sometimes I wish I had a blade hand —
Boozer: Okay, I got it — Get 'em off me —
Deacon: I got this¹, Boozer —
Boozer: You fall asleep there? What's goin' on¹ brother —
Deacon: Okay, okay.
Boozer: Fourth charge — Alright — that's the last of 'em —
Deacon: Run! Boozer —
Boozer: I'm goin' as fast as I can —
Deacon: Come on! Come on!

[The charges go off, sending the entire lake into the Iron Butte valley. The
 Ripper compound on the golf course is mostly destroyed in the wake.]

Boozer: Holy shit.
Deacon: Are you okay?
Boozer: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Unless, wait a minute, was this already —

[He comically points to his missing arm, causing both men to laugh.]

Deacon: Well that never gets old, does it? Let's, uh — Let's go find Jessie.
Boozer: Yeah.

[They ride for the golf course.]

Deacon: Brother, you, uh — you did a helluva job back there.
Boozer: Yeah? I thought I was done for a coupla times —
Deacon: Yeah, I'm sorry about that —

Boozer: What the hell you talkin' about? This is the most alive I've felt since
        — oh, shit — you remember when we got trapped by that Horde in Tumalo?

Deacon: We ain't done yet —
Boozer: How many you think we killed?
Deacon: I dunno — I mean, they had it comin', right?
Boozer: Yeah, they had it comin' — guess we all do.

[They arrive at the golf course.]

Deacon: Alright, looks like we go in on foot from here. You wanna stay? Keep
        any stray Rippers from rippin' off my bike?

[He looks around at the washed-out carnage caused by the dam outburst.]

Boozer: Yeah — I don't think we need to worry about that. And fuck that. This?
        This is on Jessie. He wants some payback? I'll show him some fuckin'
        payback.

Deacon: Come on, let's head to the lodge.
Boozer: Like I said, right behind ya.
Deacon: Jesus —

Boozer: This must be what it looked like after Noah's flood — came an' washed
        away all the wicked —

Deacon: Yeah, except God had nothing to do with this one.
Boozer: Yeah — you get my point —

[On a small overlook, they find the Lodge still has inhabitants.]

Deacon: Oh shit! More Rippers —
Boozer: How the hell did they survive?
Deacon: Oh, they didn't — they just don't know it yet —
Boozer: Deek — our left, our left!

[Deacon picks off some easy targets. Boozer then runs down to charge 'em.]

Boozer: Oh, come on, you sons of bitches — come on!

[After some reinforcements are slain, a behemoth leaves the fiery lodge.]

Boozer: A Breaker — a goddamn Breaker —
Deacon: Oh yeah, that's a Breaker —

[Deacon snipes the Breaker, finally clearing the yard.]

Boozer: Come on, that's the last of 'em.

Deacon: You ready to find Jessie?

Boozer: Oh yeah. It's time to finish what we started.

Deacon: These guys seem more jacked up than usual?

Boozer: Hell yeah — they musta snorted up the rest of whatever the hell drug
        they take —

[After gunning through the remaining Rippers, they enter the temple. Atop a
 broken stairwell, they can hear Carlos' ravings.]

Deacon: Yeah, there's no way you're gettin' up there.

Boozer: Yeah. Dammit. Here. Hell. I'll boost you up.

Deacon: Okay, listen. If something happens to me, there's a trail not far from
        here. You got —

Boozer: No, no, no, no, no, listen — That is not "Carlos" up there, okay? Not
        this "Founder of Rest in Peace," it's fuckin' Jessie Williamson.
        Fuckin' low-life piece a' shit scumbag who got what was comin' to him.
        Alright? Now you fuckin' go up there, and you kill that son of a bitch.

[Boozer boosts Deacon upstairs. Deacon tries maintaining stealth, but he's
 soon blindsided by Carlos, who knocks him down and blows drugs in his face.
 Carlos rips away his guns in the meantime.]

Boozer: Deek! What's goin' on, dammit! Deek! Talk to me!
Carlos: Time to get low¹ brother! Time to get low!
Boozer: Dammit, Deek!

[They start having a melee fight. Sometimes Boozer interrupts with a taunt
 from where he stands in the ground floor.]

Carlos: Deacon St. John — brought low by the lowly Jessie Williamson — brought
        low — Do you remember back in the day? You and Boozer held me down
        while Jack burned the flesh from my back — Those — those memories —
        kept me from bein' Free — Jack — Jack thought I was crazy — but I
        knew — I knew what you were — Mongrels! I was one of you!

Boozer: Wow — I see a lotta dead Rippers out here, Jessie! I dunno, maybe they
        shoulda learned to swim —

Carlos: But — but you see what you did? You see the scars on my flesh? The
        scars that kept me from bein' Found — Yeah — yeah, that's it! Then I
        knew! I was brought low — St. John — so low — but then — then came the
        Release! And the world was purged! Is that Boozer downstairs? Oh,
        you've brought him to me. Oh yes — yes! Now we're all here together!
        We will be One Mind — Deacon St. John! Oh, you, William Gray, Jessie
        Williamson — Oh, soon — soon we will all lose our names. We will all
        lose ourselves! We will all — become Free — I will help you find the
        Path — I will — help you first —

Boozer: Hey, Jessie — ya Goddamn coward — You were a Goddamn wimp then, and
        you're a Goddamn wimp now —
Carlos: Oh yeah — and then I will help Boozer — Oh — and then I will forget —
        I will become one of the Found! I will finally Rest — In — Peace!

[Deacon's knife wins out over Carlos' machete. He puts Carlos in a hold and
 stabs him in the back.]

Carlos: I see it. I see it.
Boozer: Deek! What's goin' on, dammit!
Carlos: The Path is — clear to me now.
Boozer: Deek! Talk to me!
Deacon: Yeah, me too.

[He slits the psycho's throat.]

Deacon: Rest in peace, Jessie.

[Later, the bikers walk through flood wreckage back to their bike.]

Boozer: It's done?
Deacon: Yeah, it's done. And I couldn't have done it alone.

Boozer: It was good bein' out in the shit again, y'know? But I gotta say,
        shovelin' shit, pullin' weeds — Well maybe it isn't such a bad way to
        spend the day.

Deacon: Yeah.

Boozer: Well, with Jessie gone, how many you think are left? People that we
        knew from before, I mean.

Deacon: No one. Boozer, there's no one left.
Boozer: Shit. I'm sorry, man.
Deacon: Yeah. Me too. C'mon. Let's get the fuck outta here.
Boozer: Yeah. Yeah.

[Back at Lost Lake, Deek finds Mike in the Ripper-defaced chapel.]

Iron Mike: Well, like I said, I — I know we haven't talked in a few years. I —
           guess I just figured with my Elizabeth bein' there with you an' all,
           there probably — Wasn't much point in me yammerin' away at you. Oh,
           and then — what, with all hell breaking loose, I — I thought maybe
           you weren't there, or you just didn't give a shit, pardon my
           language. I guess that's why I'm here. To say I still don't know.
           I hope you're there. I hope there's — some reason for all this shit
           we're livin' through. That's all. We'll — we'll — we'll talk again
           some other time. Oh, um — amen.

[He notices Deacon nearby.]

Iron Mike: Deek.
Deacon: Uh, yeah — Rikki told me that I could find you here.

Iron Mike: Nah, it's just these knees a' mine, y'know. It's — reason I haven't
           been prayin' all these years. Yeah, I'm not a — I'm not a
           churchgoin' type, even after livin' through that shitstorm in
           Sherman's Camp. But now, after all this, I just thought, hell, I —
           maybe now it's the time.

Deacon: I, uh — I didn't have a choice, Mike.
Iron Mike: Oh, everybody's got a choice — Deek — until they're dead.
Deacon: It's either us or them.

Iron Mike: It's always us or them. Always. You know the reason we're goin' to
           hell —  Is we can't figure out that "us" is every Goddamned soul
           that ain't walkin' around in shit-stained pants tryin' to eat us.

Deacon: Alright, you know what? You may not like it, but the world is what it
        is. Yeah, it is. Prayin' ain't gonna change that. Wishin' that it was
        something else ain't gonna make it that way, Mike.

Iron Mike: Wishin' ain't got anything to do with it. We make the world what it
           is, by what we do. All of us.

[Deacon rolls his eyes and starts leaving.]

Iron Mike: I let him go. Skizzo. Ain't no way he was gettin' a fair trial.
Deacon: You let him go.
Iron Mike: Told him to ride out. Not come back.
Deacon: Jesus Christ, Mike, do you have any idea what the fuck you've done?

Iron Mike: Yeah. I stopped another killing. And you know what? I guess I'm
           good with that.

[Later, Deacon is riding around when...]

Deacon: Boozer? Boozeman — you're not gonna believe this shit.
Boozer: Deek — what's wrong?
Deacon: Iron Mike — just let him go.
Boozer: Wait, let who go?

Deacon: Skizzo. He just — let him go. He just let him ride outta here without
        a Goddamn care in the world. Did you hear what I just said?

Boozer: Yeah, Deek. I heard ya, but — Jessie — all those Rippers — maybe —
        dunno, maybe I've seen enough killin' — you know? Like I said, bein' a
        farmer — ain't so bad. Deek?

Deacon: Yeah, okay. Boozeman. You're the — second one to tell me that. I gotta
        go. Deacon out.

[Sometime after, truther drivel takes over the airwaves.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Let me tell
          you — before this shit? We were numb and we were dumb. We were
          blindly taking in opiates of all kinds, keeping us sedated like fat,
          happy cows: candy, television, booze, heroin. And it worked. But now,
          well — We're feelin' the pain, all of it. Every cut. We are wide
          awake and we are watching. You see the truth of what I've been saying
          since the beginning. No one can get anything past us. We're the ones
          running the show now, and we're doing a damn sight better than the
          Feds ever did. Take a deep breath and hold it in. You're free men.
          No one can take that away from you again. This is Mark Copeland for
          Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Yeah — Cope — I'm feelin' the pain — who fucking isn't? Well, fucking
        Jessie "Carlos" Williamson. Rest in peace.

[While in Lost Lake, Deek sees Rikki giving Addy bike lessons.]

Rikki: No, this is your clutch.
Addy: I know where the clutch is.
Rikki: Alright. Do you want me to show you how to do this or not?
Addy: Yes. But I know what a clutch is!
Rikki: Okay. Fine. Alright, you do it yourself, okay?
Addy: Fine.

[Flashback: Deacon pulls to Cloverfield's front gate.]

Jim: Hey, hey, hey! What're you doing? You can't park here.
Deacon: Uh, I'm just here to pick up Sarah —

Jim: This is private property¹, now turn around and get the hell outta here.
     Come on.

Deacon: Okay.
Jim: Move it.
Deacon: Yeah.

[He slowly tries turning his bike to get out.]

Deacon: Okay, uh, you know what though? I think I'm just gonna wait right here.
        You can go back to doing your "guard the cornfields" thing.

Jim: This is Officer Moore at the gate. We got an issue here. Hey, listen¹
     asshole, this is a restricted area. I told you, get the hell outta here!

Deacon: Okay, yeah — listen —
Jim: Hey, hey, you just wait right there. I told you. Move it.
Deacon: It's like I was trying to say, I'm just here to pick up —
Jim: You sonofabitch, do you not see that sign?

[He points to a 'no trespassing' placard.]

Deacon: Oh, look at that. That's kind of hard to miss.
Jim: I am authorized to use deadly force.
Deacon: Yeah. Thank you. I can read.
Jim: You stupid sonofabitch —

[He pulls his weapon.]

Deacon: Whoa — whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sarah: Hey, hey, hey, whoa, what's going on?
Jim: I'm — sorry, Ms. Whitaker, what — do you know this asshole?
Sarah: Its — it's fine, Jim. Yeah, he's with me. He's with me.
Jim: Sorry, Ma'am, I — I didn't know that —
Sarah: C'mon, let's go. It's fine. Honestly. I apologize.

[They walk to the bike.]

Sarah: Jesus.
Deacon: Oh and Jim?
Sarah: Deacon!
Deacon: I'm not with her, she's with me.

[She suddenly revs the bike into action.]

Deacon: Oh, shit —
Sarah: Hold on tight.

[They hit the road.]

Sarah: Why do you always do that?
Deacon: Do what?
Sarah: Act like such a dick.
Deacon: Oh, c'mon — he started it.
Sarah: What, are you five?

Deacon: Hey, watch the clutch — remember you gotta give it gas — rev up the
        RPMs —

Sarah: I got this.
Deacon: Yeah, I can hear. Where we headed?
Sarah: Over to the dam. That's a nice quiet road, right?
Deacon: With you driving? No.
Sarah: Are we still going out tonight? You said something might come up.

Deacon: Oh crap, yeah, uh — Boozer and the boys want to ride down to Klamath
        State — visit Jack.

Sarah: So you're gonna blow me off to see some guy in prison.
Deacon: Jack's not some guy.
Sarah: I know, I know. I was kidding.

[A speeding semi trailer draws near them.]

Deacon: Oh shit! Look out!
Sarah: Shit!

[They pull off to the roadside, narrowly avoiding vehicular danger.]

Sarah: Oh God. Oh my God. Jesus, I don't know what it is, but every time I'm
       on a bike with you, some idiot in a truck tries to run us off the road.

Deacon: Oh my God. No, no, no, listen, listen, listen, you did great, you did
        great. Most people, they would have panicked, they would have
        oversteered and that would have gotten us killed.

Sarah: I almost did get us killed. I was —
Deacon: No.
Sarah: God, I wasn't paying attention, and I was distracted.

Deacon: Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Just breathe. You're okay. Wait a second.
        What did — did you mean distracted?

Sarah: No, it's just stuff going on at work. It's nothing, I just —
Deacon: Oh. Okay, uh — I just thought maybe you, uh, saw my new — patch.
Sarah: Your what? No. NOMAD? Wait. You — you quit the club?

Deacon: No, I didn't quit the club. I would never quit the club. Uh, NOMAD,
        what it means is¹ um — well, I'll be less involved. From now on.

Sarah: Deek, I didn't ask you to do that.

Deacon: No, I know, I know. And if you had, I would have said no. You ready to
        try this again?

Sarah: Yeah. I mean, no, but yeah, I will. Okay.
Deacon: Thank you for saving my life.
Sarah: Well, you know. I do what I can.
Deacon: Hey, hey, the clutch, the clutch!
Sarah: I know what the clutch is!
Deacon: Okay, no, no the —
Sarah: Deacon!

[They recover and get back on the road.]

Deacon: So, uh — do you think your parents are gonna come?
Sarah: To the wedding? I don't know.
Deacon: I mean, you know, I thought if I stepped back from the MC that¹ uh —
Sarah: I don't think it's gonna matter to them, Deacon.
Deacon: But you're gonna — you're gonna at least tell 'em —

Sarah: Yeah, if you want me to. Look, it's just — I'm not gonna change who I
       am — and who you are — to make my uptight, middle-class parents happy.

Deacon: Okay. Look out.

[A squad car races by them, sirens blaring.]

Sarah: I see them.
Deacon: Hey, are they — are they headed to your work?
Sarah: Oh, shit.

[They follow the car.]

Sarah: What about the MC? Are any of them coming, now that you've gone NOMAD?

Deacon: I don't know, uh — it's probably been a while since any of them set
        foot in a chapel — and do you really want twenty-seven Harleys rolling
        up on that little church in Marion Forks?

Sarah: Yeah — you know what, as a matter of fact, I do.
Deacon: Uh — okay.

[They arrive back at Cloverfield. The squad car ahead is let through the gate.]

Jim: Ms. Whitaker's returned.
Deacon: What's goin' on?
Sarah: I don't know.
Jim: Ms. Whitaker —
Sarah: Yeah —
Jim: — the chief's been trying to get a hold of you. Says it's urgent.
Sarah: It's always urgent. Let him know I'll be right there.
Jim: Okay.
Sarah: I gotta go.
Deacon: Hey, hey —
Sarah: Sorry —

[She kisses him goodbye.]

Sarah: It's fine, it's probably just a fire alarm or something small.
Deacon: Okay. Knock 'em dead.
Sarah: Love you. Um, just call me later.

[Deacon sees Jim glowering at him, so Deek flips him off. The flashback ends.]

Rikki: Look, Addy, I'm sorry.
Addy: Whatever.
Rikki: Addy —
Addy: Whatever¹ Rikki!
Rikki: I'm sorry. Goddamn.

[The girls storm off. Deacon suddenly has an epiphany.]

Deacon: Clearance. clearance¹! Uh, O'Brian, this is St. John, come back.
        O'Brian, this is St. — just answer your Goddamn radio!

O'Brian: St. John. Didn't think I'd hear from you again.

Deacon: Yeah, neither did I. Alright, listen — That night you bugged out, you
        told me that you didn't take any civilians, you just took, uh — NERO
        personnel, Feds, people with clearance.

O'Brian: I told you, there was nothing I could do, we didn't —

Deacon: Shut up, shut up, shut up, listen to me. Sarah, my wife, she had
        clearance. She had her ID badge with her the night that I put her on
        your chopper.

O'Brian: I don't think that they —

Deacon: So — Just do me a favor, look it up. Sarah Irene Whitaker. She worked
        at Cloverdale. She had federal clearance. She was doing, uh, I don't
        know, research, pharmaceutical — I don't know what she — the hell she
        was doin'. Just do me —

O'Brian: Okay. okay¹! I'll see what I can find.

O'Brian: St. John, this is O'Brian.
Deacon: O'Brian. Whaddya got?
O'Brian: I need to see you in person.

Deacon: Oh, Jesus — O'Brian. Just — would you tell me what you found — is — is

O'Brian: I — have something to give you.
Deacon: O'Brian —

[Afterwards...]

Boozer: Deek? Iron Mike's lookin' for you — he said —

Deacon: Boozeman — listen, just, uh — tell him I'll be back. I gotta — you
        remember what I told you, um — the night that Sarah died, NERO — they
        bugged out, they only took their own people, Feds and people who had
        federal clearance levels —

Boozer: Wait — Deek — what the hell are you talkin' about?

Deacon: Look, it's probably nothing — but there's — something I gotta do.
        Deacon out.

[Deek heads for the coordinates.]

Deacon: Information — what information¹ O'Brian? What the hell can you possibly
        have left to say — that I would give a damn about?

[Deek visits the mountain valley where O'Brian's chopper has already landed.]

Deacon: So, what the hell?

O'Brian: I managed to recruit a few guys who I trust, who like me, aren't happy
         with what's goin' on.

Deacon: So why am I here?
O'Brian: I wanted to give you this. You were right. About your wife.

[He hands over Sarah's old Cloverfield ID badge.]

Deacon: Where did you get this?

O'Brian: When Silver Lake evacuated they took NERO personnel, federal officials
         —  And well, Sarah Irene Whitaker had a class four federal clearance
         level.

Deacon: Clearance level —
O'Brian: Your wife bugged out with a recon unit, east of Fort Rock.
Deacon: Take me there.
O'Brian: No.
Deacon: No? Well, you got a ride. we're¹ all friends now.
O'Brian: The base is gone.
Deacon: What?
O'Brian: Year ago — a local Militia group.
Deacon: Militia group? Where's their camp?
O'Brian: We don't know.

Deacon: How the hell can you not know? You got a helicopter, you got satellites
        —

O'Brian: Somewhere around Crater Lake. But it's a no-fly zone, okay? They got
         outposts, rockets, RPGs —

Deacon: Crater Lake.

O'Brian: Crater Lake. Look, I wanted to tell you about the work we're doing?
         Studying the infected — the Freaks? They're evolving. As bad as things
         are right now — They're gonna get worse. A lot worse.

[O'Brian climbs into the helo and it flies off.]

Deacon: Ah — go to hell, O'Brian. I don't — give a shit about any of that —
        Boozer — Boozerman, come back.

Boozer: Yeah, Deek.

Deacon: Hey, listen — listen to me, uh — a year ago, we were with Iron Mike,
        we were thinking about riding south, but the Santiam Pass was blocked
        — there was no way through — and he said that he knew another way —

Boozer: Deek — Iron Mike — he's — he's not too happy with us right now —
Deacon: Just listen to me — just listen to me — do you remember what he said?

Boozer: Iron Mike? Yeah — he was — braggin' about knowin' every goat trail in
        a hundred miles — said there was, uh — a trail that went around Mt.
        Thielsen? Mt. — Thielsen — I dunno, somethin' —

Deacon: Thielsen — Thielsen — yeah, that's it. The Thielsen Pass —

Boozer: Yeah. Well, why the hell're you — wait — NERO — shit. You've — you've
        talked to — she's alive? Sarah's alive? Deek?

Deacon: Okay, listen to me — O'Brian — they, uh — Boozer, he found her ID
        badge — yeah, Boozer, uh — I — I think that she's alive.

Boozer: Deek — well, you never lost hope. You always knew — you never gave up.
        So what're ya gonna do?

Deacon: I don't know, Boozer — I don't know. Uh — but — God, if there's even a
        chance that she's alive — I — well — I gotta find her.

Boozer: Goddamn right. Um — shit — I — I gotta go. Uh — Rikki and Addy need —
        need help puttin' up a — shelf or some Goddamn thing. Look, I — I'll
        see you when you get back to camp. Boozer out.

Deacon: Okay, okay — see ya, Boozeman.

[A while afterwards, Rikki calls in.]

Rikki: Deacon — where are you?
Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki. Uh — I — I got some shit I gotta take care of —
Rikki: Are you coming back?
Deacon: Am I coming back? What — what do you — what do you mean?
Rikki: Boozer told us —
Deacon: Boozer told you — okay¹ look, there's nothing to tell.
Rikki: There's no way over the Santiam Pass, you know that.

Deacon: Yes, yes, I'm coming back. Listen, like I said — I got some shit to
        do. Deacon out.

[More truther jank plays after Rikki signs off.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. It has come
          to my attention that some of you are out there working with NERO. The
          very same NERO we saw cut down a group of survivors not long ago. The
          same NERO that abandoned us here in the shit two years past. Some
          would call these people fools, but I got a better name for 'em:
          traitors. And I assure you, I don't take treason lightly. But, I am
          a reasonable man, so you get one warning. Listen up! Stop what you're
          doin'. Now. Before we find you. 'Cause we will. And when we do, you
          will pay. I'll personally string you up on the biggest tree I find.
          And while you're breathing you're last, we'll quarter you and feed
          you to the Freaks you love. That is a promise. This is Mark Copeland
          for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Yeah, well — Cope — I gotta say, I don't like it any more than you. Do
        your worst.

[Deek rides back into town after meeting O'Brian.]

Deacon: Alright — let's see what the old man's got to say —

[Deacon goes up to speak with Iron Mike.]

Deacon: You know a way over the Thielsen Pass. You told me once that, uh —
Iron Mike: I told you nothin'. Go on! I can't help you, Deek.
Deacon: Oh c'mon. Just draw me a Goddamn map?
Iron Mike: After everything you've done?

Deacon: After everything that I've — What about what you've done, old man? Huh?
        Sherman's Camp —

Iron Mike: You go on —
Deacon: The things that you did —
Iron Mike: — you get out of here! You leave me be!

Deacon: — hey, no, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me — What if you could
        take it all back, huh? What if you could fix it.¹ That night I put
        Sarah on the chopper, I felt relieved. How fucked up is that? Huh? I
        was relieved, Mike. That's what I've been livin' with.

Iron Mike: And now you're chasin' ghosts. You think findin' your ol' lady — if
           she's alive — You think that's gonna fix it? Make you whole?

Deacon: I don't know, but I gotta try.

Iron Mike: Alright. If I do this — what you want, show you the way over the
           pass — You don't come back. Alright? You promise me — You don't
           come back.

Deacon: I gotcha.

[Mike walks off.]

Deacon: Oh, shit — now I gotta — talk to Boozer —

[He walks outside the lodge and hears two NPCs talking.]

Carl: It sounds like there's some kind of militia down there, they're takin'
      the fight to the Goddamn Freakers. While we're up here pissin' our pants
      about a buncha Rippers.

JT: Okay, so whaddya wanna do? Go down there? What's blockin' the road, snow
    and ice? We — we just wait for it to thaw.

Carl: There's a bunch of abandoned cars, would take forever to get past. No,
      no, no. That's the least of our worries. There's a Horde. The biggest
      one you ever saw. There must be over a thousand.

JT: Are you shittin' me?

Carl: It's down there, right off the road to the south. I saw it on my way
      back.

JT: Jesus — what the hell you doin' runnin' off where there's a Horde? And you
    don't even tell me?

Carl: I didn't know it was there. Makes you wonder why no one else told us
      shit.

[Deek goes over to his and Boozer's cabin.]

Boozer: Holy shit.
Deacon: Boozer, I — I —

Boozer: Last winter. We're up on Farewell Ridge. We're watchin' the Freaks.
        Thousands — thousands of 'em. I mean, too many to count.

Deacon: Yeah, I remember.

Boozer: All I could think was every one of us, man, woman, and child, are now
        homeless. Buncha Goddamn refugees. Yeah. The world belongs to them now.

Deacon: We'll survive.

Boozer: Yeah, we been doin' that all right. Survivin'. Isn't livin'. Somethin'
        Jack used to say — "Doesn't matter when you hit the road, where you're
        headin' out to — But you damn well better know where you're comin' home
        to."

Deacon: You know, we never talked about it. Why we still wore the colors — All
        this time out in the Freakshow, when shit like this didn't matter
        anymore.

Boozer: Yeah. Habit, I think. Last two Mongrels on earth. Farewell originals.
Deacon: The biker boys — most badass Drifters on the broken road.
Boozer: Damn straight.
Deacon: Yeah, I guess we did become a sort of a brand.
Boozer: We were a lotta things, but we were never a brand.

Deacon: When we rode outta Farewell — Without Sarah, without Jack, or anyone —
        I know that we were — leaving everything behind. Everything that
        mattered was gone. Except this.

[Deacon hands over his cut to Boozer.]

Boozer: You ridin' NOMAD again, huh?
Deacon: Yep, I guess I am.

[They give each other a hug.]

Boozer: Come on, Jack. Inside. Let's go. If she's out there — you'll find her.

[Boozer walks inside with his pup.]

Iron Mike: Deek, you ready?
Deacon: Yeah, Mike. I'm ready.
Iron Mike: Meet me at the gate. Don't keep me waiting.
Deacon: Yeah, sure, Mike. Whatever you say.

[Deek heads to the front gate. Rikki and Addy come over.]

Deacon: Hey.
Rikki: Heard Big Mike is taking you over the pass?
Deacon: Yep.

Rikki: You really think she's still alive? Billions of people are dead, but
       somehow she made it.

Deacon: Hey, we made it, didn't we? If I give up now, if I don't — if I don't
        do this. Hell, then I'm just gonna end up like, uh —

Rikki: Like us — right? Like Iron Mike? Like Boozer? What'd you call us —
       campers, yeah?

Addy: You go, and you find your woman.

[Addy walks by Rikki.]

Addy: You know where to find me.

[Addy leaves.]

Rikki: Hey, you know what? You know what I think, Deacon? I think that you're
       — you're afraid to be here. You're afraid to be a part of something. We
       need you here and that scares the hell outta you.

Deacon: I'm sorry.
Rikki: Yeah. Me too.

[She stomps off. Mike arrives soon after.]

Iron Mike: You ready?
Deacon: Yeah. I wanna get the hell outta here.
Iron Mike: Come on, this way.
Deacon: Okay, I'm following you.

[The pair leaves Lost Lake at night.]

Iron Mike: Took Jack out fishin' once — before, y'know?
Deacon: No shit —
Iron Mike: He caught one — didn't know what the hell to do with it.
Deacon: That sounds like Jack —

Iron Mike: He ran a pretty tight club. Oh, you boys raised some hell back in
           the day — but I don't think you murdered anyone. Not in cold blood.

Deacon: It's not murder if they shoot at you first.

[They keep riding.]

Iron Mike: You know how many tourists we used to get through here, come summer?

Deacon: A few.

Iron Mike: Thousands — too many to count. Highway'd be bumper-to-bumper with
           SUVS and campers chock full'a sunburned moms, beer-chuggin' dads,
           and their snot-nosed kids. Goddamn rainbow of floppy hats, Hawaiian
           shirts, and flippy flops. All summer long they'd come, like a trail
           of colorful ants, from LA to Farewell, to here. Non-stop.

Deacon: I'm glad I avoided road trips out here that time of year.

[They ride through the Rogue Camp tunnel into ex-Ripper territory.]

Iron Mike: We can use the help.

Deacon: I don't have a choice, Mike.

Iron Mike: Yeah. Fair enough. Come on, just follow me.

Deacon: Yeah, okay.

[They reach a frigid tunnel that leads to Mt. Thielsen.]

Iron Mike: This is it. This is as far as I go. Keep followin' the trail. It'll
           take you down the mountain, on into the Diamond Lake valley. I wish
           you luck. Hope you're right about your old lady still bein' alive.

Deacon: She is.

Iron Mike: Well maybe so. What you gotta ask yourself¹ Deek, is what does it
           matter if everyone else is dead.¹

Russell: You're not from around here. You come over the pass?

Deacon: Uh, no, no, no, I've just been¹ uh — drifting. I came over the¹ uh,
        Salt Flats, east of Silver Lake.

Mullins: Huh. What — what the hell are you even doing out here, man? How'd you
         get across the 97?

Russell: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa — Jesus, man.
Mullins: What?
Russell: The guy just saved your freakin' life —
Mullins: The Colonel told us to look out for anybody enterin' the territory,
         north or south — the —

Russell: Freakin' slow your roll, man. We'll let the Captain deal with that,
         okay?

Mullins: Fine.

Russell: He just killed a freakin' Rager, dude. Come with us. We got a camp
         just by Diamond Lake. Get you three hots and a cot — least we can do.

Deacon: Okay, yeah — sounds good.
Mullins: What about Flores? We can't just leave him here.

[They look at the nearby corpse, evidently ripped apart by the rager.]

Russell: Uh — you stay here. I'll come back with some fuel.
Mullins: No.

Russell: Listen — stay here. Use the ammo if you gotta. You'll be fine. Okay?
         Let's go.

Deacon: Following you.

[Deek and Russell start riding down the mountain.]

Russell: You gotta stay with me, okay? Been havin' some trouble with Squatters
         out here the past few weeks. A patrol picks you up, could be trouble.

Deacon: Okay, got it. So, uh — Deschutes County Militia?

Russell: Look¹ man, all I know is they feed me. They want me to salute 'n' "yes
         sir?" I salute 'n' say, "yes, sir."

Deacon: How big's your outfit?

Russell: The camp out here? We got a hundred, maybe more. Hard to keep track.
         Back at HQ? A whole lot more'n that.

Deacon: Yeah? Okay, uh — any women?

Russell: Hell, that what you're about? Well, you can forget it. Colonel's got
         rules about that — frat — fratern — fratini —

Deacon: Fraternizing.

Russell: Yeah, that. Look, you pull your weight, follow orders, nobody messes
         with you. Women same as the men. Don't matter to the Colonel.

Deacon: I'm not — listen — I — I'm just — I'm looking for some people, and a
        woman, that I rode with, a year back or so. They would've come over
        from Silver Lake, and they would've been at one of those NERO refugee
        camps, I think.

Russell: Silver Lake? Jesus¹ man, Silver Lake's been gone a lot longer'n that.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. It — it's too Goddamn easy to lose track of time out here,
        you know? Anyway, you guys, uh — do ya pick anyone up? Survivors, I
        mean, from, uh — from the refugee camp.

Russell: Maybe. Like I said, it's a big frickin' army, you know? Ask the
         Captain. He came in across the salt flats¹ I think. He might know.

Deacon: The Captain?

Russell: Yeah — Kouri. He commands the Diamond Lake outpost. We're almost
         there.

Deacon: I've been looking to¹ uh, settle down¹ yeah, find a camp — I'm

Kouri: Come on. So — how long you been Drifting?
Deacon: Hard to say, uh — you lose track of time out there, you know?
Kouri: So — where'd you get your gear? Ammo?

Deacon: There was a couple of camps I used to do runs for, bounty hunting —
        mostly.

Kouri: Freaks — or men?
Deacon: Both. I had a reputation for — bein' able to track shit down. You know?
Kouri: Well, which camps? Where are they?

        Lake was overrun?

Kouri: Oh, yeah. That was a shitshow, I can tell you.
Deacon: Uh — any survivors?

Kouri: A few. Here, take this. Militia scrip — camp credits. Payment for
       helping my men. Use 'em at any of the commissaries.

Deacon: Okay.

Kouri: You gonna join up? Stick around. We're getting ready to ride out of
       here soon.

Deacon: Gettin' ready to ride out where?
Kouri: You said you had some tracking skills?
Deacon: Yeah, some.

Kouri: This isn't the life of a Drifter. We're fighting a war out here. You
       sure you're up for it?

[He gazes over at some recruits doing jumping jacks.]

Deacon: Is that the best you got?

Kouri: I can recruit you, but the Colonel is the only one who can swear you in.
       You stick around, give us a hand — I'll take you to him myself.

Deacon: I'll be here.
Kouri: Good.

[Kouri walks off.]

Deacon: Oh, Jesus — Jesus, motherfucker has my ring. He took it from Sarah. He
        had to take it from Sarah because she wouldn't have given it to him. So
        that means that she's gotta be here.

[He spies an odd recruit nearby.]

Deacon: Hmm — he doesn't look like Militia. Hey. Uh — you don't look very
        Militia to me. Um —

Taylor: Nah, man. Name's Wade — Wade Taylor. You can call me Wade.
Deacon: Deacon St. John. Listen —

Taylor: You see this, man? This is some crazy shit.
Deacon: Yeah.

Taylor: Whew. So¹ what, you joinin' up? Becomin' an army man? You playin'

Taylor: Yeah, man. Yesterday, yesterday.
Deacon: Okay — I've been —
Taylor: Been waitin' to see the Colonel or whatever the hell that is —

Deacon: Traveling with some people, we got separated. You see anyone that
        looked like this around here?

Taylor: Uh, nah¹ man — oooh, but she is a looker. I'd hit that, y'know? Ah, I
        gotta go, man. They're checkin' me for lice or some shit. Good luck to
        ya¹ Deacon St. John — Jesus, what a name.

[Taylor wanders off.]

Deacon: Jesus — that dude's fucked up. He wouldn't remember Sarah if she
        slapped him in the face. Come on¹ Sarah, c'mon — where the hell are
        you? You're here — somewhere. Maybe in these tents? Maybe in here?
        The infirmary. I mean, with her background, that's where she would be.
        Right? Nope. Not here.

[Deacon keeps searching tents and wandering.]

Deacon: No, she wouldn't be in the mechanics area. She never knew a wrench from
        a screwdriver. She's not drillin' with these clowns. I mean, c'mon —
        what am I thinkin'.¹ Even if she were here, she wouldn't be playing
        soldier with this bunch of assholes. She's not in the commissary. She's
        not in the mess. I mean, that's where — well — that's where I would be.

Kouri: You want to join the Militia? You're gonna have to prove it to me. See
       if you can keep up, St. John.

[They ride through the blasted hellscape around the fort.]

Deacon: So what the hell happened back there? I mean — it looks like a forest
        fire but the stumps are charred — so that means — that means that the
        timber was cut before it was burned.

Kouri: You got a good eye. We call it the "Dead Zone" — we use the timber to
       build our barricades, then burn the slash. From the outpost, we can see
       a Horde coming long before it reaches us.

Deacon: And what, you — you gonna burn all the buildings too, so the Newts and
        the Swarmers have nowhere to sleep?

Kouri: You know your Freaks, huh?

Deacon: It's like I said, I been out in the shit for a long time. So that's
        your plan, huh? The Militia, I mean — to burn everything to the ground.

Kouri: We're fighting a war out here, St. John. We'll do whatever it takes to
       win.

Deacon: A war?

Kouri: That's what it is, isn't it? A war? You been out in the shit. You seen
       the Hordes. The only thing that's going to stop them — is an army. Our
       army.

Deacon: It's gonna take way more than an army.

Kouri: Well, we have a plan. The Colonel lets you join — he'll fill you in.
       So, Silver Lake — you asked about survivors. Are you looking for
       someone?

Deacon: What — no. No — not really. I mean — look. There were some folks² I
        rode with once. And I thought maybe they ended up there.

Kouri: Ah. I thought maybe you were after someone — for a bounty, I mean.

Deacon: Yeah, no. I tracked men over long distances before — but — not this
        far. No bounty's worth that.

[They reach the rager cabin on Mt. Thielsen. Torres' body is being burned.]

Kouri: This is it.
Mullins: Hey¹ Corporal, the Captain's here.
Russell: It's done, sir.
Kouri: Make sure you make a marker.
Russell: Yes¹ sir.

Kouri: Alright, you two head back to Diamond Lake. Grab, uh — Taylor was his
       name?

Russell: Yes¹ sir.
Kouri: Yeah. Take him to the Colonel. I'll be there in eighteen hundred.
Russell: Sir?
Kouri: Military time, Corporal. You're supposed to know this by now.
Russell: Well, yes¹ sir.
Kouri: Get the fuck outta here.
Russell: Yes¹ sir.
Kouri: You find something?
Deacon: Uh, how long has¹ uh —
Kouri: Vasquez.
Deacon: How long has Vasquez been with you guys?
Kouri: Couple of weeks. Maybe more.
Deacon: Huh. Well, he's been busy.
Kouri: What the hell?
Deacon: You guys been having trouble with supply runs? Marauder attacks?
Kouri: Yeah.
Deacon: Okay. We're gonna go on foot from here.
Kouri: On foot? Why?

Deacon: Because Vasquez came out here for a reason. I can't track him from the
        bike.

Kouri: Got it. Where do we start?

Deacon: It's been snowin', so, uh — there won't be any bootprints. Come on. I
        want to look inside the cabin.

Kouri: Okay, I'm following you.

[Deek goes inside and searches a bag on the bed.]

Deacon: You, uh — you said he stole rations, ammo?
Kouri: Yes.

Deacon: This is an MRE — it's half eaten. So — looks like your men rode up on
        him when he wasn't expecting it. His bike's still out front, which
        means that he went out the back.

[They go outside.]

Deacon: Wait¹ over here.
Kouri: What'd you find?
Deacon: The fence has been cut. No rust.
Kouri: So it was cut recently.
Deacon: Yeah. Come on. This way. Hey, hold on for a second. Look — over here.
Kouri: Tracks?
Deacon: Uh, yeah. We're in luck. This way. Wait, wait, wait — hold up.
Kouri: You find something?

Deacon: Yeah, shell casing. Recently fired. He, uh — well, he stopped to shoot
        at something. Come on, down here.

[Deacon kills a wolf nearby.]

Kouri: Look out. More wolves!
Deacon: I see 'em. Got ya. Yep. That's the last of 'em.
Kouri: Yeah, yeah¹ looks like it. Nice work.
Deacon: Okay — I wanna take a look at this thing.

[He inspects the elk carcass.]

Deacon: Looks like the MREs weren't enough for your man — clean gunshot, right
        through the head.

Kouri: Yeah, the wolves must have heard the shot, decided they wanted it more
       than Vasquez.

Deacon: Yeah, the rest of the pack came at us from back that way, from the
        east.

Kouri: You think they chased off Vasquez, leaving one to guard the carcass.
Deacon: That's my guess.
Kouri: Come on. Let's see if you're right.

Deacon: You guys got a lot of wolves out here? Ones that aren't infected, I
        mean.

Kouri: We get reports almost every day.

Deacon: When I was a kid — growin' up — there were no wolves in Oregon. I mean,
        a few coyotes, but no wolves. They'd been driven to extinction by
        ranchers and farmers. Timber companies.

Kouri: Well, it looks like they're making a big comeback.

[Ahead is something pinned under a wolf carcass.]

Deacon: Hold up, hold up, hold up —
Kouri: Well, what is it?
Deacon: Uh, it's a backpack —
Kouri: It's one of ours —
Deacon: Looks like they almost got to him —
Kouri: — and he shrugged off the pack to get away —

Deacon: Nah, nah, nah — to buy time — He landed on his ass, tried to scramble
        away, but then the wolf lunged — Vasquez dropped 'em. Two shots.

Kouri: You can tell all that?
Deacon: Yeah.

[If Deacon tries taking some of the dropped supplies/ammo:]

Deacon: Mind if I take some of this shit?
Kouri: Not at all. We might need it when we catch up to him.
Deacon: Remind me to thank Vasquez once we find him.
Kouri: Yeah. Of course.

[Ahead, Kouri stops Deacon as they approach an overlook.]

Kouri: Wait — get down — a Swarm.
Deacon: A NERO grave site.

Kouri: I don't think this one's marked on our map. They're scattered all over
       the region.

Deacon: Yeah, well maybe that explains why, uh — Vasquez? Came through here.
        Let's go around.

Kouri: Exactly what I was thinking. St. John, this way.
Deacon: Yeah. Right there with you.

[If Deacon foolishly alerts the Horde:]

Kouri: Wait! We're not out here to fight Freaks. Goddammit¹ St. John!

[They continue on.]

Deacon: I gotta say, I'm gettin tired of runnin' and hidin' from these
        sonofbitches.

Kouri: You ever take on a Swarm?
Deacon: Yeah, I've done it before. You just gotta keep movin'.

Kouri: Well¹ look, if you're gonna join the Militia, you must stay focused on
       the mission. We're not out here to fight Freaks.

[The Horde starts leaving shortly afterward.]

Deacon: Bein' in the shit — killing Freaks — kinda goes hand-in-hand, doesn't
        it? Okay, um — put some distance between us and the graves. The cold
        weather's gonna bring out even more of 'em. I think they can smell a
        corpse from about a mile out.

Kouri: Part of our slash-and-burn strategy is to find these grave sites, dig
       'em up, and burn them along with everything else.

Deacon: Yeah, well, good luck with that. I've seen hundreds of 'em, just — in
        this part of the state alone.

Kouri: Well, we gotta start somewhere. Alright, where now?
Deacon: Keep headin' east. Hey, there's a road ahead. Hold up a second.
Kouri: What do you think?
Deacon: Is anyone else tracking him?
Kouri: Not that I know of.

Deacon: Ah — well, then he's either dead — Or he's got a lot of friends. See —
        see how his tracks have been overriden by bikes. A lot of bikes.

Kouri: Hmm — Okay. C'mon. Let's see where they're heading.

[They follow the bike tracks.]

Kouri: You said cold weather brings out the Freaks?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah, cold, snow, rain — hell, even clouds.

Kouri: Well like I said before — you know your Freaks. When we get to Command,
       there's some people who'll want to talk to you.

Deacon: People?
Kouri: The Colonel will fill you in — if he lets you join.
Deacon: Yeah, yeah — I think you said that already.

Kouri: Look, he runs a tight outfit. I just don't want you to get your hopes
       up.

Deacon: Hey, don't worry about me. I don't really give a damn either way.

[Further on...]

Deacon: Hey, wait — hear that?
Kouri: Yeah. It's coming from the logging camp, over there.
Deacon: Is that on your map?
Kouri: Yeah.
Deacon: Well, that means it's also on Vasquez's map.
Kouri: Come on. If Vasquez is there, what would your strategy be?

Deacon: Well, he's not alone. We know that from the tracks — Yeah, what's that
        Militia penalty for going AWOL?

Kouri: Hanging by the neck until dead. Why?
Deacon: Well, it means Vasquez isn't coming without a fight.

[The pair creeps into camp and takes cover behind some old logs. Hoodlums are
 hanging around, and provoking, a woman.]

Deacon: Do you see your man?
Kouri: Yeah — that's him.

Deacon: Well, looks like you guys need to start doin' background checks on
        your recruits. He seems to be right at home.

Kouri: Well — let's wait here. I'll radio for backup —
Survivor: Get your Goddamn hands off me —

Vasquez: Oh, ho, ho — this one's a fighter, boys! Whaddya think? We'll see
         about that —

Survivor: Let me go, you sonofabitch!
Deacon: Oh — hell no —
Kouri: What?
Deacon: Uh — I just got this problem with assholes who hurt unarmed women.
Vasquez: C'mon, I promise I won't hurt you too much.
Kouri: I'm giving you an order.

Deacon: Order? You see me wearing a red armband? You don't give me orders yet.
        You do whatever the hell you want.

[After Vasquez drags the woman into a cabin and locks it up, Deacon goes to
 work slaying the outdoor guards. If he nears the shack, arguing is heard.]

Deacon: Shack's shut up tight.

Vasquez: Goddammit, what the hell's wrong with you? You said you wanted to
         join us!

Survivor: Screw you.
Vasquez: This is how it goes down.
Survivor: I'm Goddamn warning you, you asshole.
Vasquez: Yeah? You're warning me. That's too Goddamn funny!
Survivor: I'm not laughing.
Vasquez: Goddamn bitch! Don't make me —
Survivor: Go ahead — try¹ asshole.
Vasquez: Sonofabitch.
Survivor: That's all you've got? Tough guy?
Vasquez: I'm gonna choke the life outta you —
Survivor: Thought that's why we're here. Go ahead — do it —
Vasquez: Don't try me, bitch.
Survivor: I'd rather screw that knife than your two¹ inch pecker, motherfucker.
Vasquez: You — bitch!

[Deek proceeds through the camp with Kouri helping.]

Kouri: More men, in front of you.
Deacon: Got 'em. You stay behind me. You give me cover if you have to.
Kouri: St. John, men coming.
Deacon: Thanks. Got 'em.

[Deacon and Kouri kill the fifteen sentries.]

Deacon: Is that the last of 'em?
Kouri: Yeah, I think so. Nice work.
Deacon: Come on. Let's go deal with your man.
Kouri: Vasquez — he isn't my man. Not anymore.
Deacon: Okay — wait here, stand guard in case we missed anyone.
Kouri: You can handle him?

Deacon: He won't know what hit him. Yeah — this is it. I can get in through
        here.

[Deacon enters the shack, finding the survivor stabbing Vasquez's corpse in
 the crotch repeatedly.]

Deacon: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa — easy, easy — I'm not gonna — I'm
        just here to help.

Survivor: I don't need your Goddamn help.
Deacon: Okay. I'm just gonna move over here.

[He lets the woman run off.]

Survivor: Stay the hell away from me!
Kouri: Hold on, hold on now — we're not with them —
Survivor: You think I give a damn who you are?
Kouri: Okay, okay —

[Deacon comes out to find the woman ran off past Kouri.]

Kouri: What the hell was that?

Deacon: Just your typical damsel in distress.
Kouri: Vasquez?
Deacon: Done. Way — done.

Russell: We brought up your bikes, Captain. Thought we'd save you the walk
         back.

Kouri: That'll be all, Corporal.
Deacon: So how'd I do? Did I pass?
Kouri: Pass?

Deacon: Well, you've been watching me all day. I figured this was, what — some
        kind of test.

Kouri: No. Nothing quite as formal as all that. As you can see — our pool of
       recruits isn't what it used to be.

Deacon: Yeah.
Kouri: But yeah. You passed. So. You ready to meet the Colonel?
Deacon: Yeah, sure. Why the hell not?

[The two start riding down Mt. Thielsen.]

Kouri: So¹ St. John, where did you serve? Before the shit went down? You know
       what an MRE looks like, you know how to recon an enemy position, you
       know "cover and advance" tactical maneuvers. So — where did you serve?
       Marines? Army?

Deacon: I try not to talk about it, you know? I mean, first year out here —
        seemed like anyone who used to wear a uniform had a target on their
        back. I, uh — I was in the army. Tenth Mountain — I did a full tour in
        Afghanistan. So how about you? Anyone who's ex-military has a — a
        certain bearing. None of your "soldiers" have it — but you do.

Kouri: Like I said — you've got a good eye. I was in the Air Force, ten years
       — part of SAC.

Deacon: There ain't no missile silos in Oregon.

Kouri: I was on vacation, believe it or not. I was lucky. Before satcom went
       down, I got hourly reports from across the country — you think it was
       bad out here? Everything east of the Mississippi was overrun within two
       days.

[They reach a highway with a great view over the riverlands below.]

Kouri: Hold up. I want to show you something.

[Both disembark and hang out near the vista overlook.]

Kouri: So you familiar with this area?

Deacon: Yeah. I grew up in a town north from here, uh — It's called Farewell.
        You know it?

Kouri: No. Ah, it sounds like a fitting place to be living at the end of the
       world.

Deacon: Yeah, tell me about it.
Kouri: Well, maybe you have been here before.

Deacon: Yeah, I've been here. A few summers back, me and my ol' lady — or my
        wife — stopped by here on our honeymoon.

Kouri: You got a pic? Uh — of your wife, I mean.

[Deacon chuckles; Kouri fishes out his own pic.]

Kouri: Her name was Karie. We were married twelve years when — Anyway. It was
       a long time ago.

[As Kouri reminisces, Deacon has a flashback to him and Sarah on a midnight
 ride. They stop near an old fence and get off. Sarah looks at a sign.]

Sarah: Hmm. You know I — I think this might mean "Keep Out."
Deacon: Huh? Oh, no, no — that doesn't apply to us.
Sarah: Why, because we can't read?
Deacon: Because we don't obey the law.
Sarah: Speak for yourself.
Deacon: After you.
Sarah: Alright. Y'know, making me a co-conspirator? Not very chivalrous.
Deacon: Chival — what?
Sarah: It means, um — right. I never learn.

[He helps her through the fence and they walk toward the timberline.]

Sarah: I'm sorry about that.
Deacon: Oh my God! You should have seen the look on your face.
Sarah: Oh! I bet it was funny —
Deacon: Yeah, if I owned a cellphone, I'd have taken a picture.
Sarah: Well, for just this once, I'm glad that you don't.
Deacon: Oh, come on. Don't start on that again.
Sarah: Hey — I didn't say anything,¹ you brought it up.
Deacon: You just did.
Sarah: So — where're we going?
Deacon: Just follow the trail. You'll see that it's not that far —

Sarah: What would my mom say if she knew I was out on a midnight stroll — in
       the middle of nowhere — with an outlaw biker?

Deacon: Well, I dunno — she'd say, "Honey — you better wear your sweater —"
Sarah: Very funny.

Deacon: She wouldn't say anything, you know? You weren't supposed to tell them
        about us, remember?

Sarah: Oh¹ c'mon, Deacon — I said that a long time ago. You know I didn't mean
       that.

Deacon: Hey, look — I'm not judgin'. I'm just — I mean, I — I haven't told my
        old man.

Sarah: That's because your father's dead.
Deacon: Well, yeah, I mean, there's that.

Sarah: The question is — have you told anyone in the MC? That you're dating a
       nice girl from Seattle — and not some bimbo from whatever strip club you
       guys live in.

Deacon: Oh — well — okay, wait a second. No, we don't live in a strip club. I
        mean, we have a lifetime membership there — that's true — but we don't
        live there. And second — uh — I did tell them, yeah. Matter of fact, I
        did.

Sarah: Wait, you — you did?

Deacon: Well, yeah — oh, c'mon — don't sound so surprised. They find your PhDs
        to be very sexy.

Sarah: Oh, yeah. I bet. So — you know this is way past my bedtime, right?
Deacon: Oh — I know.
Sarah: Oh, c'mon, stop. I mean — I really do have to get up early tomorrow —

Deacon: Yeah? Uh — how's that goin'? I mean, you, uh — well¹ you never want to
        talk about it, so —

Sarah: It's nothing — it's just — it's just this project — I mean, we've got
       some execs flying in from New York to audit our progress — and the suits
       at our facility are installing a new lab without even showing me the
       spec, and —

Deacon: Well, I thought you didn't want to talk about it —

Sarah: Sorry — it's just — you know what, like I said, it's nothing. Anyway —
       thank you — for dragging me away from all that.

Deacon: Yeah, no problem.

[They continue up the trail, deeper into the forest.]

Sarah: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait — is this a pot farm? Is this what you
       wanted to show me?

Deacon: Say what?

Sarah: Well, these are marijuana plants, and that's an irrigation system. So
       this here — this is a pot farm.

Deacon: Oh¹ hey, yeah, look at that — pot farm.

Sarah: You dragged me out in the middle of the night, to the middle of nowhere,
       to show me the MC's — illegal — growing operation.

Deacon: Uh — yeah. I mean, you got me. I was hopin' that you could give us some
        tips, you know, on cultivation — put all those PhDs to work on
        something actually useful.

Sarah: Jesus, Deacon, what — okay — I get it. This is not actually what you
       wanted to show me, right?

Deacon: No, of course it's not — c'mon, keep following the trail,¹ we're almost
        there.

Sarah: Yeah, you think I would learn — you think I would learn, but I never
       learn.

Deacon: Nope.

Sarah: Oh my God — God, look at that moonlight — it is — it's so beautiful.
Deacon: Keep goin', uh — we're almost there.

Sarah: You ever wonder what it would be like if — just everywhere — all at
       once — the lights went out and everyone could just — see the world, just
       like this?

Deacon: What, you mean — like all dark and shadowy and depressing?

Sarah: I mean the moonlight, the wildflowers, and the fireflies — oh, I see,
       you were kidding again. Okay, you don't take anything seriously.

Deacon: Oh, I take everything seriously.
Sarah: Yeah right!
Deacon: I do.

Sarah: You do not. Like when I suggested moving some of my stuff over to your
       place, you pretended that I was joking.

Deacon: Uh-uh, no — that's not true. I pretended I didn't hear you. There's a
        big difference.

Sarah: You should have seen the look on your face. And you know, I do have a
       cellphone and I took a picture. You want me to show you?

Deacon: My God, you're a scientist. Can we — be rational about this?

Sarah: Okay, first of all, all I said is that we should think about moving in
       together. You know, 'cause we'd get to spend more time together, and,
       you know, take the next step,¹ what's irrational about that?

Deacon: I have a toothbrush at your place.

Sarah: Oh, I'm so sorry. You know what? You're right. That is a huge
       commitment.

Deacon: Well, I mean — do you know how much a good toothbrush costs?

Sarah: Okay, see? There you go again. Every time I try to talk about our
       future, you turn it into a joke.

Deacon: Okay, alright. We do need to talk about it — and we will talk about it
        — but, just — hold on for a second 'cause I wanna — I wanna show you
        something. Okay? See? This — is why I brought you out here.

[They reach a hideaway clearing with a nice waterfall.]

Sarah: Wow, how beautiful.
Deacon: Was it worth it?
Sarah: God yes.
Deacon: Hey, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Sarah: Yeah?

[She turns around to find him on one knee.]

Sarah: Oh — Deacon.

[He puts his Mongrels ring on her finger.]

Deacon: Will you — will you, uh —
Sarah: Will I?

[She playfully pushes him down and climbs on top.]

Deacon: So that a "yes?"
Sarah: On two conditions.
Deacon: Name 'em.

Sarah: Okay, well the first one is that we don't have one of those biker
       weddings — Where you say that you're gonna ride me as much as your bike.

Deacon: Done. I couldn't promise that anyway.

Sarah: Oh stop. Okay, the second one — the second one is that you never leave
       me.

Deacon: Done.
Sarah: God, did you just put your biker ring on my finger?
Deacon: Uh, you know what? I think I probably did.

Sarah: Look at it! It's so cute with its little fangs, just like, clenching
       onto the chain. You know nothing says true love like "dog skulls."

Deacon: — "dog skulls."
Sarah: Hey, what does it say there?
Deacon: Oh I'm sorry, I thought you knew Latin.
Sarah: Come on.
Deacon: Well, it's — "Morior Invictus" — it means "Death Before Defeat."

Sarah: Wow, I like that. But you're gonna get me, like, a real ring though,
       right? Not that this one's not great. I — I just thought.

Deacon: Oh, absolutely. Because, you know, that's my ring. You can't keep that.
        Right.

Sarah: Right, it's your ring. Something more simple, without fangs.
Deacon: Okay. Alright.

[As they're about to kiss, her phone rings.]

Sarah: Oh shit, I'm sorry.
Deacon: No, that's alright. Okay.

Sarah: It's the lab. I gotta get it. Hello? Yeah — no, no, no, that's fine.
       I'll be right there. Okay, bye.

Deacon: Is everything okay?
Sarah: I don't know. They need me back there,¹ I gotta go.
Deacon: What? This minute? Like, at this time of night?

Sarah: Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to go, but I promise I'll make it up to you.
       C'mon.

Deacon: Okay. Okay.

[The flashback ends. Deacon hands the picture back to Kouri.]

Deacon: My wife's name was¹ uh — Beth. No. I don't have a pic.
Kouri: Let's go.

[The two mount back up.]

Kouri: Not unusual, you know.
Deacon: I'm sorry — what's that?
Kouri: To not have any photos — of your wife — family.
Deacon: Yeah? Why do you say that?

Kouri: Back in the day everyone used smart phones. That's where we kept all
       our photos — when phones went away — when the cloud went away — our
       photos went with them.

Deacon: Yeah — I guess I hadn't thought about that.

Kouri: My wife — Karie — her father was a photographer. Old school. Darkroom,
       chemicals, all that. Too stubborn to embrace the digital age, I think.
       If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have any photos either.

Deacon: Yeah, well I hated 'em — cellphones, I mean. Seemed like everyone
        walked around with their noses buried in the damn things. I never
        owned one.

Kouri: Interesting. How'd you manage that?

Deacon: I worked as a mechanic. I, uh — I had my own shop. Probably had the
        last landline in Farewell.

[The two ride down to the bridge connecting Wizard Island -- a large mountain
 in the middle of a lake -- to the coast. It's heavily fortified. A guard lets
 them through into the camp.]

Deacon: You guys are taking this shit seriously.

Kouri: Colonel believes with enough motivation and discipline, we can achieve
       anything.

Militia Soldier: C'mon, hurry your ass up.
Worker: I'm going as fast as I can.
Militia Soldier: Just move it.
Deacon: Is that your idea of motivation?

Kouri: Colonel had set up a work camp on the south side of the island — For
       those unfit to serve. Some of them require extra encouragement.

Deacon: I'll bet.
Kouri: C'mon. Follow me.
Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

[They walk to a crowd gathering near a platform with two people on it. A noose
 hangs from a gibbet nearby.]

Kouri: Stand up there with the others. Good luck, St. John.

[Deacon goes to stand near Taylor and a mouthy woman.]

Crystal: Got your ass too, huh? Whatever.

Taylor: Hey¹ man. It's good to see you again. St. John, right? Son of a
        preacher man.

Deacon: Taylor, what — what's this son of a preacher man shit you keep sayin'?
Taylor: I'm just kiddin' with ya, man. Hey, did you have any luck?
Deacon: What?

Taylor: The — the woman you were looking for — you and your peeps were ridin'
        with —

Deacon: No.

[A soldier walks over.]

Soldier: I need all your jewelry, watches, shit like that — c'mon, in the bag.
Crystal: Say what?
Taylor: Sure¹ man, whatever you say.
Crystal: The hell you say.

Soldier: Recruits aren't allowed personal effects. Besides, shit's just gonna
         get stolen. Come on. Cough it up.

Crystal: Oh yeah, shit's gonna get stolen. Goddamn bullshit.

[Colonel Garret walks into the area.]

Garret: Ten-hut!

[Deacon salutes, but Crystal refuses to.]

Crystal: Pshh.

Garret: At ease. Visitors are not welcome here. You are here, because you were
        invited. Recruited by my trusted officers. When you answer me, start by
        giving me your name, last name first.

[He walks over to Crystal.]

Crystal: Getting by, same as everybody.
Garret: Name.
Crystal: Shit. Adkins, Crystal — sir!
Garret: How many men have you killed?
Crystal: Before? Or after?
Garret: Answer the question.
Crystal: Fuck you!

Garret: We have all done things that we're not proud of. To survive. To stay
        alive. The Almighty understands this. The Almighty forgives this. But
        here, upon this woman's face, are the footprints of Satan. Prison
        tattoos. Proof of what you once were, and, no doubt, still are. It's
        people like her that are responsible for bringing the wrath of the
        Almighty down upon us all. Take her to the work camp.

Crystal: What the — fuck you — Fuck you all! Buncha Goddamned redneck assholes
         — get off me!

Soldier: Come on, gorgeous! Let's go — Move it!
Crystal: I swear to God! Get off me!

[A soldier carts her off the platform.]

Garret: What about you?

Taylor: Uh — Taylor — uh — Wade. And¹ um — no sir — I, uh — never been to jail,
        never killed anyone, nothing like that.

Garret: You've been in the shit for a long time.

Taylor: Yeah, I mean I — I know — I know how to shoot stuff — My — my dad took
        me huntin' when I was a kid — At a camp, near Klamath Falls, it got —

[He holds up a hand to silence Taylor and walks to Deacon.]

Garret: And how about you, son? You know how to use a gun?
Deacon: St. John, Deacon. Yeah, I know how to use a gun.
Garret: You're a Drifter. Hold out your right arm.

[He looks at the army tattoo across Deacon's hand.]

Garret: Tenth mountain¹. Iraq?
Deacon: Afghanistan.
Garret: Honorable service? And don't lie to me, I'll know.
Deacon: Served one tour. Served with honor. Hated every Goddamn minute of it.
Garret: Though¹ shall not lie. Good man. Hold up your right hand.

[The colonel brings him front and center.]

Garret: Do you solemnly swear to support and defend the New Constitution of
        these United States — Against all enemies, natural and unnatural, to
        bear witness and support to the same — And to obey all orders without
        question, so do you swear.

Deacon: I swear.
Garret: Dismissed. Walked with me, son.

[The crowd disperses.]

Garret: Captain Kouri doesn't bring me many recruits these days — he must think
        highly of your combat skills.

Deacon: Uh — I've been in the shit a long time.
Garret: You know your way around the Freaks?
Deacon: Yes, sir. I¹ uh — I know as much as anyone. Sir.
Garret: Good, good. In here. We'll have the doc take a look at you.

[They enter Doc Jiminez's medical tent and he patches up Deacon's arm.]

Jiminez: Pulse is strong. Good heart rate. Got a pretty nasty burn there.
         How'd that happen?

Deacon: Uh — had a run-in with a wood stove.
Jiminez: Wood stove, huh? Who dressed this?
Deacon: I did.
Jiminez: No está mal. Not bad at all
Deacon: Thank you.
Jiminez: Keep it dressed or you're gonna lose that arm — you hear me, amigo?
Deacon: Yeah — yeah, I hear you.
Jiminez: I want you to check back with me in a few days.
Deacon: Got it.
Garret: Well, Doc?
Jiminez: Oh¹ he's fit to serve. Lo hará bien. You doing runs out in the shit?
Garret: Sorry¹ Doc, ya tiene novia. He's spoken for.
Jiminez: Let me guess. The Wizard Island Witch. Vaya con Dios. Good luck¹
         amigo.

Garret: Let's go¹ son.

[They exit the tent.]

Garret: I normally don't tolerate insubordination — referring to an officer
        as a "witch." But I make exceptions for some of my more — eccentric —
        officers.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

Garret: I make exceptions — because every man and woman still living has a role
        to play. Do you believe in God, St. John?

Deacon: Never gave it much thought — sir.

Garret: Well, it's high time that you did. He has a plan for us. All of us.
        And my part — is this.

Deacon: Sir?

Garret: This — place. I had a vision — oh, nothing so grand as those described
        in the Old Testament — no flaming chariots or burning bushes — I —
        simply woke up one morning — before God's plague had rained down upon
        the world — and knew that this was the place.

Deacon: Crater Lake — uh — Wizard Island?
Garret: I call it the ark. Are you familiar with the story of Noah's Ark?
Deacon: Yeah — I mean — yes¹ sir. I mean, everyone's — everyone's heard of it —

Garret: Indeed. You'd be surprised how few have read the Bible or the book of
        Revelations.

Deacon: You mean Genesis, Noah's story, I — I mean, um — that — it — it's the
        book of Genesis — sir.

Garret: Yes, of course.

[They walk into the mountain through a cave passage.]

Garret: Okay¹ son, let's get you squared away.
Deacon: Whatever you say.

Garret: Now, we don't have much in the way of uniforms, I'm sorry to say, but¹
        uh — I think that¹ uh — oh, here. Try this on.

[He hands him a militia cap to replace Deacon's old one.]

Deacon: Seems to fit.
Garret: I'll take that.
Deacon: Well, if you don't mind, this is a gift from an old friend.
Garret: An old friend. Not many of those left anymore, are there?
Deacon: No, there are not.

Garret: Okay¹ soldier. But I don't want to see you wearing it. You're one of us
        now. And normally, we start new recruits in the rank of private. But
        since Captain Kouri has vouched for your experience in the field —
        We're starting you out at the rank of corporal. Congratulations, son.

Deacon: Thank you — thank you, sir.
Garret: Now, let's get you some work. Alright, now what was I saying —
Deacon: Uh — you were tellin' me about the ark. Sir.

Garret: Yes — the ark. What you see here is only a small part of it. Behind us
        is a whole network of caves and vents that lead from here up to the
        cone's peak. When our work is complete they will be filled with
        thousands of seeds, plants, computer files, and books. The world may
        die, but our achievements in medicine, science, and technology will not
        die with it.

Deacon: No sir.

Garret: But the island is more than just an ark, Corporal. It is a stronghold
        — a fortress. Here at the North Gate, we are stockpiling enough
        munitions to take the fight to the Freaks. We have rifles, grenades,
        heavy machine guns, and RPGs. We have the equipment to make ammunition
        — every type, every caliber. 

[They walk by some outdoor tents and facilities.]

Garret: This is our mechanical engineering area. If you need your bike
        repaired, see the officer on duty. And as you can see here, courtesy
        of the old National Guard, we are building a fleet of trucks and other
        vehicles. Once the Hordes are cleared from the highways, we will begin
        to rebuild the roads and bridges.

Deacon: Your "slash and burn" strategy may stop Newts and Swarmers, but it
        won't clear the highway. It won't — it won't stop the Hordes. Sir.

Garret: We are aware, Corporal. The Hordes — the Hordes are a different beast
        entirely, aren't they. But we have a plan.

Deacon: Plan, sir?

Garret: Benjamin Franklin once said, "by failing to prepare, you are preparing
        to fail." We are not going to fail. The heart of the army lives here,
        at the gate, ready to move on my command. These tents house hundreds
        of women and men — just like yourself — who have pledged and sworn
        their lives to the fight. But I have something else in mind for you.
        An assignment that requires more than just the ability to survive in
        the shit, or use a gun. Are you up for it, son?

Deacon: Uh, yes¹ sir. Wherever you need me.
Garret: You asked how we were going to defeat the Horde? Let me show you.

[They enter another tent. A scientist's concoction sends up sudden sparks.]

Weaver: Whoa, now. Shit.
Garret: You okay¹ Lieutenant?
Weaver: Oh, hey¹ Colonel, sorry about that. Too much acetone in that batch.

Garret: Lieutenant Weaver is our chemical engineer,¹ he's working on new ways
        to —

Weaver: To blow shit up.
Garret: — defeat the enemy.
Weaver: Sorry. But yeah. Uh — name's Weaver. James.
Garret: St. John, Deacon.
Weaver: All this Militia shit's just for show, right¹ Colonel?

Garret: Corporal St. John is new to Kouri's unit. If you need anything from
        out in the shit, he's your man.

Weaver: Oh, shit yeah. Here, there's a couple of things I need.
Deacon: What are you working on?
Weaver: Oh, just the new gelling agent combining naphthenic and palmitic acid.
Deacon: You're working on napalm?
Weaver: Yeah, yeah — this dude knows his shit.
Deacon: Just a lucky guess. Uh —
Garret: Sorry to interrupt.
Weaver: Oh, anytime. Oh, Colonel. I'm getting real close, Colonel. Very close.
Garret: That's good. That's really good.
Weaver: Where're you going next, Colonel? Wizard Island Witch?
Garret: That'll be all¹ Lieutenant.

[They leave Weaver's tent.]

Garret: Again, let me apologize for my more — eccentric — officers.
Deacon: No need, sir.

Garret: We have one final stop. As much as I believe in Lieutenant Weaver's
        work, what you're about to see could be, I think, our path to victory.
        In here.

[They enter the "Witch's" tent and find her speaking to another soldier.]

Sarah: Alright, what is this?
Soldier: Ma'am? I got everything on the requisition form —
Sarah: Does this look like fabric softener?
Soldier: No¹ ma'am.
Sarah: Okay, why don't you read it.

Soldier: Active ingredients. Chlor — clor — oh — form — And uh, A-terp — terp
         — terp — in — Shit.

[She takes the bottle away from him.]

Sarah: Get out. Get out! Matt, I can't do this if I have to do my own supply
       runs.

Garret: I got it covered. Lieutenant Whitaker, this is Corporal St. John. He's
        a new member of Kouri's unit. He's got some experience out in the shit.

[Sarah doesn't acknowledge that she knows him.]

Sarah: Read this.
Deacon: What?
Sarah: Read this. I mean, you can read, can't you?

Deacon: Active ingredients. Chloroform, A-Terpineol, Benzyl Alcohol, Ethyl
        Acetate —

Sarah: Good enough. When can he start?
Garret: I'll leave you to it. Carry on, Lieutenant.

[The colonel leaves.]

Sarah: Leave us.

[The other soldier nearby does as well.]

Deacon: Sarah —
Sarah: Stand at attention.
Deacon: Sarah, I —
Sarah: Don't.

[She runs a hand over his face.]

Sarah: No¹ you're — you're — you're dead. You're — you're dead. You're — you're
       supposed to be dead.

Deacon: Hey — hey, hey, hey —
Sarah: You're dead. You're dead.
Deacon: It's okay. I'm right here.

[They share a brief kiss, but she pulls a way.]

Sarah: Wait — wait a — wait a second¹ I — I don't understand — I couldn't find
       you —

Deacon: I — I thought you had died and I¹ uh — Boozer and I —

Sarah: No — we were overrun and — We had to go south — NERO, they said that no
       one made it out — Farewell was overrun — They said that everybody was
       dead.

Deacon: We — yeah, NERO — no — I found O'Brien and I found a way — over the
        mountain —

Sarah: I never thought I would see you again —
Deacon: And I didn't think that I would ever see you again.

[He tries to kiss her again, but she pulls back.]

Sarah: No — no, I can't — I can't —

Deacon: Hey, hey listen. Now, we can ride outta here, we'll pick a direction,
        we won't look back. C'mon —

Sarah: No, you — wait a — No. No, Deacon. I can't —
Deacon: Are they — are they forcing you to stay here?

Sarah: No. You don't understand. We're fighting a war. Don't you see? This is
       a war that we can win.

Deacon: I didn't come here to fight a war.

Sarah: I can be helpful. I can make a difference, but I — I can't go with you.
       I have to stay here. Don't you get it, you — you can stay here with me.
       Help me. Look — afterwards, whatever you say — we — we — we can go
       wherever you want.

[A soldier comes back 'round.]

Soldier: Colonel's looking for you.
Deacon: Whatever you say, ma'am.
Sarah: Wait — wait a second. Your requisition form. Thank you, soldier.

[He leaves Sarah's tent. A RFO broadcast can be heard if outside city limits.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. The Feds
          were whining babies, suckling at the teat of us taxpayers. But dumb
          as they were, we can't underestimate 'em. You gotta know the chief
          muckety-mucks are hiding out there in some bunker, waiting for the
          Freaks to die off. They didn't save the hungry, or their precious
          constituents — you know, the real reason they're in power? They saved
          the elite, the men and women who played ball. They're sittin'
          underground probably drinkin' Champagne while they wait. Meanwhile,
          we're out here dyin' — sufferin' — all so the Feds can hit the damn
          reset button. But they didn't account for one thing: we're not as
          stupid as they thought we were. And once they emerge to "reclaim the
          world" when the Freaks are gone, we'll be waitin'. Oh, yes we will.
          And they'll be sorry they ever came out of hiding. This is Mark
          Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Ah, Jesus — even all the way down here, I can't get away from Goddamned
        Radio Free Oregon.

Garret: Corporal St. John, is it?
Deacon: Yessir.

Garret: Come in. Just enjoying a cup of tea — herbal, courtesy of Lieutenant
        Whitaker. Would you like to try some? It's very good for the digestion.

Deacon: Uh, no, sir, thank you¹ sir. I'm — I was just looking for the duty
        roster.

Garret: I have an assignment for you. Men, Corporal — not that they deserve to
        be called that — they've taken one of ours. Lieutenant Justine Norwood.
        A fine officer.

Deacon: And they have her, so, uh — yes, I will get her back, sir.

        Dismissed.

[Deek returns to Kouri's outpost later on.]

Kouri: Corporal. Good. I have a job that requires your — unique skills.
Deacon: Uh — sure. Yeah — uh — yes¹ sir.
Kouri: You remember Vasquez?

Deacon: The man who went AWOL — yeah, we tracked him to the logging camp. I
        remembered.

Kouri: Well this man — Sergeant Lee Anderson — was his partner. He was about
       to be arrested when he killed a guard and took off.

Deacon: Your men have quite the "code of honor" —

Kouri: Our men. You're one of us now. Remember? I've marked the location on
       where he was last seen on your map. Apparently, like Vasquez — he wasn't
       alone.

Deacon: Great.

[Deek rides out on Anderson's trail, coming to the Maclaughin Point suburb.]

Deacon: Captain Kouri — I'm at the site where Sergeant Anderson was last seen.

Kouri: Well if he still has it, take his Militia insignia. I won't have it
       soiled by the stench of a traitor.

Deacon: You got it. St. John out. Alright¹ Anderson — let's go take care of
        business. Oh — he's gotta be here somewhere — Where the hell is he —
        Okay — let's take a look around.

[Deek comes across an infected wolf's corpse near mauled bodies.]

Deacon: Which way — Oh shit — wolves — Gotta take a closer look. Oh my God —
        is that Anderson that they're dragging? Oh — how the hell am I gonna
        get my bounty?

[He follows the blood trail to a cave.]

Deacon: Dead Coyote Lava Cave — well — nothing bad can happen with a name like
        that, yeah?

[The trail leads further into the runners' den.]

Deacon: Squeeze through here — You still got your Militia arm band?

[He loots Anderson's wolf-chewed corpse and exits, only to find a bear nearby.]

Deacon: Oh shit — Rager. Dammit. Maybe — I can sneak around?

[Deek returns to Kouri later.]

Deacon: Captain. I found your man — Anderson. And — you were right — he still
        had his Militia insignia —

Kouri: He's dead?

Deacon: Let's just say that he had a run-in with a pack of wolves long before
        I got to him.

Kouri: That's a fitting end for a murderer and a thief.
Deacon: Yes¹ sir.
Kouri: Thank you, Corporal. Dismissed.

[Deek rides out of camp, and no sooner has he done so, than...]

Taylor: Corporal St. John — uh — Wade Taylor to Deacon St. John.

Deacon: Taylor. Uh — I hear a bike. Tell me you're not out in the shit trackin'
        down that drug trafficker.

Taylor: Okay, okay — I won't tell you that. But I am.
Deacon: Goddammit — Taylor — you're gonna get yourself killed —
Taylor: Nah¹ man, no, no — hey, I followed a bunch of 'em up the highway —
Deacon: Highway 97?

Taylor: Hey, hey, it was — no, it was — it was daylight — weather was clear —
        I didn't see a single Freak. Uh — but there is this — this group of —
        of men, ended up at the ski lodge — did you even know there was a ski
        lodge out here? I didn't know that.

Deacon: Taylor —

Taylor: It's a sweet¹ ass setup too. If I ever decide to bug out, that is where
        I'm goin' — oh, shit, I gotta run. They're — they're stoppin' at
        another camp. Taylor out.

[Deek radios into Kouri after Taylor's convo.]

Deacon: Deacon St. John to Captain Kouri — St. John to Kouri, come back.

Kouri: St. John, I've just spoken with the Colonel — he's assigned you to the
       research division.

Deacon: Captain, uh — research division — uh, I guess you could call it that —
        uh — I'm helping Lieutenant Weaver and Lieutenant Whitaker.

Kouri: Good. They can use all the help you can offer.

Deacon: I don't know how much help I'm gonna be — I'm just sorta — their errand
        boy for now. And actually — that's why I radioed in. Lieutenant
        Whitaker gave me a requisition form that says yeast.

Kouri: Yeast? Hold a second. We have patrols making supply runs throughout the
       region. When they come across anything of potential value they note it
       down — yes — here. Yeast and other baking supplies were noted in the
       kitchen area of the Crater Lake Visitor's Center. You know where that
       is?

Deacon: Yeah, I can find it.
Kouri: Good luck, Corporal. Kouri out.

[Deek heads to the other side of Crater Lake to find the destination.]

Deacon: Visi - Visitor's Center. That's gotta be it. Now — just gotta find
        some yeast. Kitchen — yeah, well. It's gotta be in the kitchen. Oh,
        shit — Breakers. Had to be Breakers. It couldn't be fuckin' easy,
        could it?

[Deacon slays the Newts and Breakers in the parking lot.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em. Okay — now where the hell's the yeast.¹

[He jimmies the lock on the kitchen building and infiltrates.]

Deacon: Yeast — yeast — Ah, here it is. Yes. I hope this is enough. St. John
        to, uh — Lieutenant — Whitaker. Reporting in.

Sarah: Deacon, uh — Corporal St. John. Yes.

Deacon: I, um — got the item on your requisition form. The yeast. There wasn't
        much.

Sarah: I — I'm sure that — whatever you have is gonna be fine.
Deacon: So, um — just curious, uh — why do you need —

Sarah: Sorry, I'm right in the middle of something, I gotta go. I'll talk to
       you when you bring it in. Whitaker Out¹.

Deacon: Okay. You're welcome —

[Later, Deacon delivers the yeast to Sarah personally. She's mad at something.]

Sarah: Oh, Goddammit.
Deacon: Ma'am.

[He salutes.]

Sarah: Look, would you stop doing that, please?
Deacon: I'm sorry?
Sarah: I know that things are strange, but I can't help that right now.

Deacon: Well, I live in a barracks with a dozen Militia assholes — While my
        wife lives in a private tent up on an officer's ridge. Nothing strange
        about that.

Sarah: Deacon —

Deacon: And the only time that I see her is when I'm done running one of her
        errands. Nothing strange about that either. Ma'am.

Sarah: My yeast. Thank you.

Deacon: Uh, are — are you baking something? I mean, if you need an oven, I
        know where to find one.

Sarah: No, no, I'm using it to create viral proteins, that they — they trigger
       these antibodies — But of course, you were being sarcastic.

Deacon: Bread — viral proteins, it's all the same to me.
Sarah: Hey, wait a second. Here.

[She hands him another requisition form.]

Sarah: Thank you.
Deacon: You already said that.
Sarah: I meant, for staying.
Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am.

[As Deek leaves, his radio crackles to life.]

Jiminez: No, no, set them over there. Thank you. Corporal St. John? This is
         Doctor Jiminez. St. John?

Deacon: Hey¹ Doc, this is Deacon. What can I do for you?
Jiminez: Oh, St. John. Good. I need you to stop by the infirmary.
Deacon: Uh — is something wrong? You need something?
Jiminez: No, no. Nothing like that. I want to check on that arm.
Deacon: My arm? My — my arm's fine, doc.

Jiminez: A burn like that — from a wood stove — is nothing to play around with.
         You want la infection? You come see me. That's an order.

Deacon: Alright¹ Doc. Alright, fine, whatever you say. St. John out.

[If Deacon heads outside town:]

Sarah: Deacon, are you there? Deacon —
Deacon: I'm here.
Sarah: Look, I know we have a lot to talk about.
Deacon: Ma'am?
Sarah: This is a private channel. Deek?
Deacon: Okay.

Sarah: I want you to know that I meant what I said about — about you staying
       and helping. I — I know this — can't be easy for you. Being here — like
       this.

Deacon: Hey, uh — where else am I gonna go? And if I leave, they're gonna make
        me give back this really cool hat, — so I'm startin' to like this hat.
        I mean, really.

Sarah: Oh, I bet. Okay, alright, I gotta get back to work. This yeast has
       already filled up like half a dozen petri dishes.

Deacon: Okay, save me some of the viral proteins — I got an appetite out here.
Sarah: I'll do that. Lieutenant Whitaker out.

Jiminez: Let's look here. So, who did you ride with back in the day?
Deacon: Uh, I don't know what you're — uh — getting at —

Jiminez: No me mientas. Look, Corporal. I spent twenty years in East LA
         patching up bandas de motoristas and every other kind of bandiero. I
         know the look. And this? No kinda wood stove did this. Alright. Keep
         it clean. It'll heal on its own. Leave a nasty scar. But I want you to
         come back and see me in a couple of days.

Deacon: You got it.

Jiminez: Funny thing. When the city burned and the Hordes came in —
         Neighborhoods at war for decades all came together. Fought together.
         Latinos, Gueros, Chinos, Bloods, Crips, didn't matter. Crazy what it

Taylor: St. John. Come in. Taylor to Deacon St. John.

Deacon: Taylor. Haven't heard from you in awhile. I was afraid that maybe you'd
        gotten too close to that man you were trackin'.

Taylor: Oh, I'm close alright. I'm right in their friggin¹ backyard. Hey, I
        need your help, man. I'm — I'm at the — at a small camp, south of
        Crater Lake, just off the South Rim Drive —

Deacon: Taylor, listen to me. I have no idea what you're doing, but you got —

[Sounds of a struggle can be heard.]

Taylor: Oh, no — oh, shit! No — no, no — no — let me go — nay — hey —
Deacon: Taylor? Taylor? Oh — dammit.

[En route, Deek overhears comrades' chatter:]

Russell: Captain Kouri, this is Corporal Russell — come in. Move back, dammit!
         Move!

Mullins: You heard him, pull back! Pull back!
Kouri: Russell. Report.

Russell: Sir — we were on a supply run, trying to get to Chemult and we ran
         into the biggest Goddamn Horde you've ever seen.

Mullins: Dammit, move your asses! Come on. Move! You heard the Corporal.

Kouri: Now¹ Corporal, listen to me very carefully. Get your men out of there.
       We are not ready to engage, do you copy me?

Russell: Yes¹ sir, you don't gotta tell me twice. Russell out. Come on, move

Mullins: We're pullin' out. Let's go! Go! Go!

 baddies working him over.]

Marauder: C'mon¹ boy. Don't give up on us. Tell us where your camp is, maybe
          we'll let you live.

Taylor: Fuck you.

Marauder: I don't think he can hear us. Let's see if we can do somethin' about
          that.

Taylor: I'm not tellin' you shit.
Marauder: Really?
Taylor: Wait, wait, wait —

[In one clean stroke, the marauder cuts off Taylor's right ear.]

Taylor: God! Fuck! My fucking — ear!
Marauder: Can you hear me now? Huh? Hello? Get him the fuck outta here.
Taylor: C'mon — Ah, fuck!

Marauder: Whaddya think? Maybe we can turn this in at that army camp! Get some
          credits.

Deacon: Jesus Christ — I'm comin'¹ Taylor — hang in there —

Taylor: No, man — no, no — I can't — please, man — don't let him — fuck —
Marauder: You better — better do it — you better do it. I'll — I'll kill him.

[If too much time is wasted, the marauder shoots Taylor.]

Deacon: Taylor! — dammit!

[Saving Taylor from his captor's the only way to move forward, however.]

Taylor: Oh, shit —

Taylor: Oh, y'know, I've had better days, I'll be honest with you.

Deacon: Yeah, uh — hey, so I — I looked at that requisition form, it says that
        you want silicate?

Sarah: Yeah, silicate. I use it as a distilling medium in the column
       chromatographer.

Deacon: Uh — column chrom — what?

Sarah: Sorry — it's just — it's the one part of my research that's actually
       going well.

Deacon: So — silicate. Where do I get it?

Sarah: Oh, shit, I thought I marked it on the req. Hold on — okay, there's this
       little general store southwest of us, near Mazama Village. You should be
       able to find it there.

Deacon: Okay, got it.
Sarah: Thank you — sorry, never mind. Carry on — Corporal.
Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am — uh — Lieutenant.
Sarah: Sarah out.
Deacon: Silicate. What the fuck is silicate anyway?

Deacon: Alright¹ fellas, how ya gettin' inside.¹ Maybe up here? I should be
        able to — climb up here. Through this hole, maybe?

Deacon: Yeah — a mom¹ and pop store. Now where the hell is the silicate? Uh —
        nope — not in here. Silicate — yeah, well — it's gotta be somewhere —
        Huh — here we go. Silicate. This'll work. Okay, now — I just gotta

Deacon: Is there a problem? Ma'am?
Weaver: Just a friendly discussion, Corporal. Lieutenant.

Deacon: What was that all about?

Sarah: Nothing. It's just — Weaver, he thinks that the answer to everything is

Deacon: Yeah. Fuck him — here.

Sarah: Thank you.

Deacon: Now, don't —

Sarah: What now, Deacon?

Deacon: Thank me. Don't thank me. Every time you thank me, I end up outside

Sarah: My bullshit — that's what you think this is?

Deacon: I — I — I didn't mean that — no!

Sarah: That everything that I'm doing is just bullshit? Course you didn't mean
       it. You know — I don't understand why you're still here.

Deacon: Well then, let me enlighten you. I spend the last two years killing
        Freaks — One by one, up close. So close, that I could smell the flesh rotting between their teeth. So if you're working on something here
        that's gonna take 'em all out at once — fuck it. I'm in. But if you
        don't want me here, you know what, just give the order. Ma'am.

Deacon: Yeah, I'm just doing my job.

Deacon: Is that right?

Weaver: Oh yeah, dude. I mean, that lady's got a fine ass. I'm an ass man. I
        couldn't help myself.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. How'd that work out for you?

Weaver: Not too good. I mean, she threw me down on the ground, tried to break
        my Goddamn arm. Listen up. You need to watch yourself with her. That
        lady's intense.

Deacon: Yeah, I'm gonna keep that in mind. Uh, you need anything else?
Weaver: Uh, no. But grab these and follow me.

[Weaver motions to some equipment and walks off.]

Deacon: Lady's got a fine ass —

Weaver: You see, polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon, while gasoline is made
        up of simple aliphatic hydrocarbons. You try sayin' that. Anyway — mix
        the two together, all those molecular chains break up into single
        covalent bonds.

Deacon: Well — yeah — everybody knows that.

Weaver: Yes! That my friend is a napalm Molotov and that is how we're going to
        win this war. Once I fine-tune the formula, that shit's gonna burn
        hotter than an acetylene torch. Know how hot that is?

Deacon: Yeah, I got a pretty good idea. I worked in an auto shop. Do you need

[Deek gives chase on his own bike, fighting off the hoodlum's allies, too.]

Deacon: Alright — come on, you asshole —

AWOL Soldier: Dammit — no!

Deacon: Where ya goin'? You can't get away!

AWOL Soldier: Corporal — listen — to me. I didn't do anything. You got that?

[When Deacon finally smashes his bike:]

Deacon: Got him! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Deacon ties up him up, as per usual.]

AWOL Soldier: What — did you — do — you son of a — a — bitch — no — no —

Deacon: Okay — what the hell — goin' AWOL is one thing — but ya didn't have to
        murder two men to do it —

AWOL Soldier: Let go — please — just let me go — I'll — I'll tell ya where I —
              I stashed it — I swear —

Deacon: Sorry, pal — tell it to the Colonel. Colonel, I've got him. Alive.

[Deek heads over to the Wizard Island Witch's tent.]

Deacon: Sarah.
Sarah: Yeah, just¹ um — put it on the counter, will you?
Deacon: Okay.

Sarah: I'm — I'm sorry. It's — this is just really frustrating for me
       sometimes.

Deacon: I wouldn't know, uh, I — I just need another requisition form.
Sarah: No, you know what, I'm — I'm not gonna give this one to you.
Deacon: What? Why not?

Sarah: 'Cause I'm gonna go with you this time. Let's go. Come on, soldier —
       see if you can keep up with me.

Deacon: Yeah right. When's the last time you went on a run? I mean, you know,
        out in the shit?

Sarah: Hey, I've done supply runs, like anyone else. I gotta admit, it's been
       a while.

Deacon: Do you even have a bike?

Sarah: Yeah — but, uh — I think I'm gonna ride with you on this run. No chance
       of us getting separated that way.

Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am.
Sarah: Stop with the — hey! You, uh — you been inside the ark yet?

Deacon: Uh — the caves here? Yeah, I got the grand tour when I arrived — from
        the Colonel himself.

Sarah: Come on, even you gotta give the man some credit — for the vision — I
       mean, stockpiling, preparing — saving what we can —

Deacon: Yeah, well — I'll give him this — this island is a Goddamn fortress.
        Nothing's gonna get in here without a helluva fight.

Sarah: Exactly. Here — this is my tent.

[They walk inside.]

Deacon: Wow, nice place. It's got that woman's touch.

Sarah: Right. I'm hardly ever here. Most nights I usually spend it on a cot in
       the lab.

[He picks up a pistol nearby.]

Deacon: Look at this! This'll get the job done.
Sarah: It was a gift from Matt when I first joined up.
Deacon: Matt?
Sarah: The Colonel. Oh¹ Jesus, come on¹ Deacon, it's just a gun.

[Sarah takes the gun and leads him back outside.]

Sarah: Come on, let's go this way. I want to show you something.
Deacon: Followin' you.

Sarah: When I got here, the Militia had cut down almost every tree on the
       island. I asked Matt — the Colonel — to save the last one.

Deacon: Oh yeah? Why — why did you, uh — do that?

Sarah: Do you remember the weekend we rode up here, to Crater Lake¹ I mean,
       after we got married?

Deacon: Uh — yeah. I — I remember.

Sarah: I remember thinking — God, when Mount Mazama blew up, I mean, how long
       did it take — for the lava to cool, and the soil to form, all these
       trees to grow? When all this is over, when we leave this fucking island,
       I want there to be at least one tree left.

Deacon: Uh — listen, these guys don't give a shit about any of that. I've —
        I've been through their "dead zone."

Sarah: Look, the Colonel's focused on winning the war. And the sooner I do my
       part, the sooner he'll stop burning everything to the ground.

[They go past the tall tree and go to the motor pool. Deacon mounts his bike.]

Deacon: What's wrong?
Sarah: No — nothing — it's just — Never mind.
Deacon: Hold on, uh —
Sarah: Hold on tight. I remember.

[The lovebirds ride out of Wizard Island.]

Deacon: Okay, where're we headed?

Sarah: There's a community college east of here, off the highway. You know the
       one?

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. Uh — let's take the south bridge. It'll be faster.

Sarah: I'm with you.

Deacon: Hey, so I gotta ask, uh — all this stuff — the — the yeast, the
        silicon —

Sarah: Why do I need it? The weapon I'm working on is a virucide. If I can
       isolate the virus that causes the cells to mutate, I can kill it.

Deacon: Okay —

Sarah: Can I ask you something? After that night in Farewell, what happened —
       I mean — how did you get out?

Deacon: Well we almost didn't. After the Feds pulled out, anyone still alive —
        started puttin' up roadblocks of their own, and they started shootin'
        people on sight. We somehow made it — to that refugee camp where we —
        uh — we thought that you were gonna be waiting, but like I said, it was
        gone. So we tried a few others — same story. No survivors. Everything
        overrun. So — within a week, the whole damn valley was a war zone.
        People were — killin' each other — over scraps of food. Sometimes
        killin' each other for no reason at all. If Boozer and I hadn't stuck
        together, I don't think we would have made it.

Sarah: Wait, Boozer? He's alive? Where is he, what happened to him?

Deacon: Yes, he's alive, but he's — he's at a camp up north. He can't ride
        anymore because — because he lost his arm. But, uh — but he is alive.

Sarah: I'm so glad he's alive — I — I'm really sorry, I should have asked you
       about him sooner.

Deacon: Don't worry about it. Okay, uh — my turn. Look, this is gonna sound
        stupid, but, um — but that night in Farewell — my Mongrel's ring —
        do — do you still have it?

Sarah: Deacon, I'm sorry. It's the Colonel's policy. They — they confiscate
       all jewelry when you come into the camp. They melt down the gold and
       silver to use in — Weaver's project, or whatever the hell. I forgot all
       about it. I'm — I'm really sorry.

Deacon: Uh — no, don't worry about it. I don't know, I was just thinkin' out
        loud. It doesn't matter. Here — I think this is it.

[They pull onto the Chemult Community College's gated access road.]

Sarah: Huh.
Deacon: You been here before?

Sarah: Once — before, you know — Career day. They invited me to give a
       presentation on exciting careers in biochemistry. God.

Deacon: What?

Sarah: Nothing. Just, looking back, it should have been a talk on "how to
       survive the end of the world." C'mon. How are we gonna get through this?
       Should we find a way around?

Deacon: No, uh — hold on. I can — boost you up there. You ready?
Sarah: Yeah —
Deacon: You got it?
Sarah: Got it — Here, watch your head —
Deacon: Got it —

[Once boosted onto the gate, Sarah knocks off a crate for Deacon to use. They
 can see a corpse-filled parking lot encampment completely abandoned.]

Deacon: Jesus, what the hell happened here?

Sarah: This was one of the earliest survivor camps — set up before they figured
       out that Hordes like to run along the main highways. It was dead long
       before I got here.

Deacon: This entire place is gonna be crawlin'.
Sarah: Yeah.
Deacon: Do you know where we're going?

Sarah: Like I said, I've only been here once but I think the science building
       is back there.

[They go up to the campus' grounds blockaded front entrance, which have...]

Deacon: Ah dammit, Newts. Okay —
Sarah: Whoa, whoa! Wait a second.
Deacon: What's wrong?

Sarah: Well — I mean, I don't wanna bring the whole place down on us. We don't
       even know what's in there.

Deacon: Well, we know what's in there — a bunch of Goddamned Newts.
Sarah: No, come on, let's just go around. We're not getting through here —
Deacon: No. Uh — whoever was livin' here jammed the place up pretty good.

Sarah: How about through here? The door's locked, but it doesn't look
       barricaded. Can you jimmy it?

Deacon: Here, let me try. I think — I can — get this — there. Got it.

[Deek opens the locked side entrance.]

Deacon: Through here, looks clear.
Sarah: Coming —
Deacon: Here, uh — help me move this —
Sarah: Hold on, okay —
Deacon: Okay, ready? Push —

[They move a bookshelf away from an entrance.]

Deacon: Okay. You ready?
Sarah: Yeah, let's go.

[He uses his shoulder to pop the door free, alerting enemies nearby.]

Deacon: Oh shit. Back, back, back, back — Swarm.
Sarah: Oh fuck.
Deacon: Yeah.
Sarah: Alright, well then we find another way
Deacon: No¹ wait a second, wait a second — We can do this. We can do this. Uh —
Sarah: What?

Deacon: If we both go out there, we're just gonna pull them down on top of
        each other, so — Wait a second. What if you climb up on top of here.¹
        You lay down covering fire. You take out the stragglers,¹ I'll take
        out the rest.

Sarah: Are you sure about this?

Deacon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do this all the time. Just keep up a steady stream
        of fire, alright?

Sarah: Deacon —
Deacon: Once I'm through¹ just close this up tight.
Sarah: Alright.

[Deacon muscles his way outside again and Sarah shuts the door.]

Deacon: Lay it into 'em. Oh no you don't — C'mon — we got this — Come on, you
        sonsofbitches —

[Eventually the courtyard is cleared.]

Sarah: I think that's all of 'em —
Deacon: Yeah, come on down — it's clear.
Sarah: You okay? God — Jesus — that was a little too close —
Deacon: Nah — we had it all the way —
Sarah: Gunfire's gonna bring in more —
Deacon: Yeah, we'll be long gone by then —
Sarah: Where now —

Deacon: Uh — I don't know — uh — they got the place barricaded up pretty good —
        Uh — see if there's a hole in any of these walls — place where we can
        climb up —

Sarah: Alright, I'll look over here —

[After a little while...]

Deacon: Anything?
Sarah: No — Hey, over here. There's an open window.
Deacon: Comin' —

[He boosts her inside.]

Deacon: You got it?
Sarah: Yeah — yeah, I got it. Hold on. Let me find something.
Deacon: Uh — Sarah?
Sarah: Hold on — I gotta find something I can throw down —

[More swarmers appear.]

Deacon: Oh shit —
Sarah: No — Deacon!
Deacon: Oh — shit, shit, shit —
Sarah: Goddammit!
Deacon: Uh — just — find something for me to climb on!
Sarah: I'm on it!

[Deacon slays the swarm, just in time for Sarah to drop a crate.]

Sarah: Deacon! Here!

[She pulls him in to the window and they both fall about the place, laughing.]

Sarah: Oh God, why are we laughing?

Deacon: I don't know. You know, I — I remember you were always trying to talk
        me into going back to school.

Sarah: Oh yeah, well — well, better late than never.
Deacon: And now you finally got your way.
Sarah: Okay, thanks. You ready?
Deacon: Mm-hmm.
Sarah: Let's go. Alright — here, let me go first this time.
Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am, whatever you say. It's like a bomb went off in here —
Sarah: Yeah. Maybe one did — Come on. I think we can get through here —

[She tries the knob.]

Sarah: Door's jammed.
Deacon: Here, let me —
Sarah: No, I got this — I got it —

[She plows through the door with some effort.]

Sarah: See? I told you —

[A Freaker stumbles at her and she reflexively fires at it.]

Deacon: Sarah!
Sarah: See? Like I said — I got this.
Deacon: Yeah. Yeah. Good job.
Sarah: Thanks.
Deacon: So, uh — how badly do you need this piece of equipment?
Sarah: Alright — we're almost there. Look, we're not giving up now.
Deacon: I'm just askin' —

[Through a door, they see a hole caused by a crashed SUV.]

Sarah: Now we know how the Freaks are getting in.
Deacon: Someone needed to learn how to park.
Sarah: It looks clear. Shit. More barricades, and they're everywhere.
Deacon: Huh, uh — check the buildings.
Sarah: I can see the science building,¹ it's over there.
Deacon: Just gotta get through these barriers.
Sarah: Hey, another open window!
Deacon: Got it. Here, let me boost you up again. Uh — only this time, you —
Sarah: Don't take so long finding something for you to climb —
Deacon: Yup — exactly —
Sarah: Got it —

[Sarah is boosted into the window.]

Sarah: Okay, hold on. Hey, and try not to attact any more Swarmers this time,
       alright?

Deacon: Sure — yeah. I'll see what I can do —

[Suddenly, Deacon can hear gunfire and Freaker noises.]

Sarah: Oh — you sonofabitch! Get off me —
Deacon: Sarah¹ hold on! Come on — come on —

[Deacon starts pushing a car underneath the window and rushes through. It's
 eerily quiet as he searches around.]

Deacon: Sarah! Sarah!!! Oh no — no, no, no — Ah, Sarah! Goddammit! Sarah!
        Sarah? Sarah! No — dammit — no — Sarah! Sarah! Where are you? Come on —
        answer me — If anything's happened to you — Sarah?! I'm gonna kill —
        every one of you fucking bastards — Sarah, answer me — Sarah — Sarah!
        Sarah —

[He turns a corner to find Sarah fine, but slumped near a lot of dead Freaks.]

Deacon: Hey —

Sarah: God — oh my God — there was — there was so many of them — They just kept
       coming — I couldn't —

Deacon: It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're okay. Hey. C'mon.
Sarah: I'm fine. C'mon, we're almost there.

[They walk outside.]

Sarah: This is the science building.
Deacon: Yeah. Looks like this place has been shut up tight from the inside.
Sarah: C'mon. There's gotta be a way in.
Deacon: Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Sarah: Yeah. I've killed Freaks before —
Deacon: No, I know, I know — it's just —
Sarah: Deacon, I'm fine. Let's go. Let's check this door. Can you open it?
Deacon: No, it's jammed from the inside.
Sarah: Let's go around the building. There has to be a way in.
Deacon: I'm telling you, someone's sealed it tight from the inside.
Sarah: Well, we gotta check, right?

[They circle the building fruitlessly.]

Sarah: Oh Goddammit!
Deacon: Hey, hey¹ it's okay.
Sarah: It's jammed. Like all the rest.
Deacon: I'm sure we can find another way —

[A noise inside startles them.]

Sarah: Oh shit —
Deacon: Wait a second.
Sarah: What the fuck?!
Deacon: Hold on — hold on a second — those are —
Sarah: Oh my God. They're inside.

Deacon: Those are Newts. Those are Newts in there. Which means — There's gotta
        be a way in from the roof.

Sarah: Yeah. Come on. C'mon — the roof's lower over there.
Deacon: Yep — we just have to — find a way up.

[They find a jeep nearby.]

Deacon: Sarah, here. Uh — help me push this. We can use it to climb up.
Sarah: Okay.
Deacon: You ready?
Sarah: Yeah.
Deacon: Okay, push —
Sarah: That far enough?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah. Hold up.

[With the vehicle repositioned, they climb onto the low roof.]

Deacon: You got it?
Sarah: Yeah.

Deacon: Okay, be ready — Newts can get pretty nasty when you trespass on their
        territory —

Sarah: I just really wish we didn't have to kill the little shits —
Deacon: What? What do you mean?
Sarah: They remind me of that little girl — the one in Farewell —
Deacon: The one that fuckin' stabbed you?
Sarah: She didn't know what she was doing.
Deacon: None of 'em know what they're doin' — won't stop 'em from killing you.
Sarah: I know that.

[They start picking off the Newts.]

Deacon: There's more of 'em —
Sarah: I see 'em —
Deacon: Look out —
Sarah: I got 'em —

[Finally, all the li'l Freakers lie dead.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em —
Sarah: You enjoyed that —

Deacon: What, killin' Newts? No, but — I mean, you gotta admit they're pretty
        Goddamn annoying —

Sarah: You're right about that —

[They find a high skylight to get through.]

Deacon: Here, give me your hand —
Sarah: Okay —

[Deek drops down into the building.]

Deacon: Careful — steady —
Sarah: I got this — alright —

[She falls into his arms.]

Sarah: Careful —
Deacon: Ugh — not only are they annoying, but they smell like shit —
Sarah: Yeah, well you try living like them — see how you smell after two years.
Deacon: No thanks — where — where — where're we goin'?

Sarah: Try these doors. Uh — one of these is gonna be a lab or a lecture room.
       Centrifuge has to be here somewhere.

[They enter a room filled with peaceful-looking corpses.]

Deacon: Hey, I don't — I don't get it. There's no, uh, bullet holes, no sign
        of violence or attack —

[Sarah smells some residue from a cup nearby.]

Sarah: Hemlock.

Sarah: What's wrong?
Deacon: Guess I should've done a better job of hiding the bike.
Sarah: Alright. Let's do this.
Deacon: Stay put — keep your head down —

Sarah: C'mon. Let's get the hell outta here.

Deacon: Hey, look — I get it. A lot's changed. Everyone we knew is — gone.

Deacon: Yeah, I — yeah¹ it's a tough job, but I'm sure you got it covered.
        Alright?

Taylor: Yeah, yeah — Hey, what's goin' on with you, man? You got some, uh —
        some saddle sores or something? Need the doc to lube you all up?

Deacon: How's the ear?

Taylor: What? I can't hear you. I'm just fuckin' with you, man. I'm feelin' no
        pain¹ brother,¹ doc's got me on some Oxy. Shit is tight. I'm fine, man.
        I'm fine.

Deacon: Okay.

Taylor: Oh, hey — uh — I saw the Lieutenant earlier. She was tryin' to get
        something from the doc.

Deacon: Yeah? 
Taylor: Yeah, thought you'd want to know.
Deacon: Alright, well, thanks. See you around, Taylor.
Taylor: Yeah, man.

[Deek goes inside and has the doc take another look at his burned arm.]

Jiminez: Estarás bien. You'll be fine. Just don't start any bar fights.
Deacon: No promises, doc.

Jiminez: You know — me parece — I was thinking, it's been a while since I've
         been in the shit. I'm getting soft. Estoy ablandando.

Deacon: Are you kid — oh. You're serious,¹ you wanna go on a run with me?
Jiminez: I used to ride myself before the world went to hell, you know.
Deacon: Alright, well¹ let's go.

[Just then, Garret wanders in. Both salute him.]

Garret: Corporal — Doc. Going someplace?

Jiminez: Colonel, it's been a while since I've been on a run, I was going to —
         Go with Corporal St. John —

Garret: No, no, no. I don't think so.
Jiminez: Col — Colonel? No entiendo —

Garret: I don't know what I would do if I lost you. If anything were to happen
        to you, you can't be replaced.

Jiminez: This is —
Deacon: Sir, I can look out for him, you —
Garret: Dismissed. Corporal.

[Deacon leaves.]

Jiminez: Matt — I've been out in the shit before!

Garret: I understand. But again — If anything were to happen to you, I — I
        don't know what I would do if I — I don't know what I'd do if I lost
        you.

[Deek visits Sarah after his checkup.]

Sarah: Well that's it. That's as far as I can go.
Deacon: How can I help?
Sarah: You can't, unless you have a DNA synthesizer somewhere.

Deacon: No, but¹ uh — there's an auto parts store near Fort Klamath I could
        check out.

Sarah: Deek, you can't get what I need there, you — God, you think I would
       learn.

Deacon: Actually, I think I know where you can get one.
Sarah: Really?
Deacon: Yeah. Your old lab. Cloverdale.

Sarah: Okay, yeah, that's great. All we have to do is find a way over the
       mountains.

Deacon: Yeah. You're right. That would be impossible.
Sarah: My God, you know a way over, don't you? Good, you can take me.
Deacon: Is that an order, Lieutenant?
Sarah: Yes. No. I'm just — I mean no, it's not an order.
Deacon: Well, which is it?
Sarah: Well, I don't know. Are you going to take me or not?
Deacon: Dress warm. Pack light.
Sarah: Hey, Deek?
Deacon: Oh my God, if you say "thank you" one more time, I —

[She kisses him hard.]

Deacon: Let me know when you're ready to go.

[As they're about to leave, Kouri and Garret walk by.]

Garret: Going somewhere, Lieutenant?

Sarah: Colonel. Captain. Yes, we're heading out to retrieve a piece of
       equipment that I need.

Garret: I see.
Kouri: How is your work progressing?

Sarah: Good. Good. With Deek — Corporal St. John's help, I've been able to
       make some good progress. Thank you for assigning him to my project.

Kouri: Well, Lieutenant Weaver's also been making progress. He says he'll be
       ready to test his chemical weapon by the end of the week.

Sarah: I heard. Mine will be ready soon.

Garret: You realize you are more valuable than any piece of equipment.
        Equipment can be replaced,¹ you cannot.

Sarah: I've been in the shit before, Matt. You know that I can handle myself.

Garret: Carry on, Lieutenant. Corporal. I'd like to see Weaver's equipment
        right now. I'd like to see what he's doing.

Kouri: Yes¹ sir.

Garret: I'd like to check on his status and figure out if he's actually as
        advanced as you've been saying.

[Kouri and Garret walk off, leaving Deek and Sarah to ride out.]

Deacon: What is that all about, anyway?
Sarah: What?

Deacon: All the yes sirs and no sirs, and the saluting and the ranks and the
        uniforms. It just seems kinda pointless, you know? Considering.

Sarah: Hey, you were in the army once. You should know.
Deacon: That was different.
Sarah: How?

Deacon: Well, there were more people in the world. I don't know. I mean —
        havin' a military made more sense.

Sarah: I think it makes more sense now.
Deacon: Why?

Sarah: It's utter fucking chaos out here. We need the order and discipline or
       we're not gonna make it.

Deacon: You know, I've been at plenty of camps that are doin' just fine without
        having a Colonel breathin' down their necks.

Sarah: You know what's funny? About uniforms and ranks seeming pointless, I
       mean?

Deacon: No, what?

Sarah: I used to think the same thing about the MC. I mean, you guys had ranks
       like "Road Captain," and "President," I mean — you wore badges and
       patches and — and tats like uniforms. And when you guys used to all ride
       together you looked like an army. Well, except for the beards and bikes.

Deacon: Now that you mention it — I — I can see your point.

Sarah: You know, I'm actually surprised you weren't wearing the cut when you
       came into the camp. I didn't think anything would make you give that up
       —  even the end of the world.

Deacon: Okay, so my cut, huh? I'm gonna have to see if the Colonel will let me
        switch uniforms.

Sarah: You know, there is that. Where are we heading?

Deacon: To Diamond Lake. There's an old forest service road that winds around
        the western base of Mt. Thielsen.

Sarah: Okay.

[They reach the snowy cabin on Mt. Thielsen's south side.]

Sarah: Was that here when you came over the pass?

Deacon: Yeah, but the soldiers stationed there were havin', uh — bear problems
        —

Sarah: Bear problems?

[Nearby is a new addition: a small manned checkpoint.]

Militia Soldier: Hey — hey! Shut it off! You're gonna have to turn around,
                 buddy. We got orders to keep anyone from —

Sarah: To keep anyone from what, Corporal?

Soldier: I'm sorry¹ ma'am. I didn't see it was you. It's — it's the Colonel,
         ma'am, he's given us orders to keep an eye out for anyone going AWOL —

Sarah: Are you accusing me of going AWOL?
Soldier: No¹ ma'am.
Sarah: Then get out of my way.

[Deacon turns the engine back on.]

Sarah: Corporal, what are you still doing there? Get the hell out of my way.
Soldier: Yes¹ ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am.
Sarah: Jesus.
Soldier: I'll have to report this —
Sarah: Yeah, you do that.

[They ride through the checkpoint.]

Deacon: Well¹ that sounds serious.
Sarah: What do you mean?

Deacon: Well¹ he said he's gonna report you. I mean — how's Matt gonna take
        that?

Sarah: The Colonel will tell him to mind his own fucking business and to never
       question an officer. Oh my God.

Deacon: What's wrong?

Sarah: Nothing — it's just — I — I mean the view up here — it — it's
       incredible.

Deacon: Uh, yeah — I guess I — just don't see it anymore — pay attention to it,
        I mean —

Sarah: How can you not? It's — it's breathtaking —
Deacon: Yeah — the world wakes up, grateful for another dawn —

Sarah: Hey, if you spent all day staring into a microscope, you might
       appreciate it more.

Deacon: Oh, I appreciate it — you know? Bein' around when the morning comes up
        is a helluva lot better than the alternative.

Sarah: I gotta be honest — you know, there were times when I didn't believe
       that — about, you know — hoping to see another day.

Deacon: Yeah, I know the feeling.
Sarah: What kept you going? I mean — back then?

Deacon: Um — I — I don't know. Just, uh — too Goddamn stubborn to give up, I
        think.

Sarah: I don't believe you.

Deacon: I did give up — Sarah. I did. And then, I don't know — Boozer's arm
        got fucked up — and I had to — I — I mean, I wasn't gonna let him die,
        you know? So — watching him — struggle to keep going, when he had no
        reason — no fuckin' reason at all — I guess I didn't want to — I didn't
        want to let him down. So, I — I didn't want to go out that way. And
        then I found out that — that you were still alive, and that — that's —
        that's when I really wanted to — that's really when I wanted to kill
        myself.

Sarah: Yeah, right.

Deacon: No, seriously — but, uh — then I remembered you still had my Mongrel's
        ring — and that's — that's what kept me goin'. Figured I'd look you
        up — get it back. But you know how that turned out.

Sarah: Shit.
Deacon: Exactly.
Sarah: Things are gonna get better. You know that, right?
Deacon: Yeah —
Sarah: Yeah. We can win this thing, Deacon. We can.
Deacon: Are you tryin' to convince me? Or you?

[They finally reach the Thielsen highway Iron Mike led Deacon to earlier.]

Sarah: We must be getting close, right?

Deacon: Yeah. We're coming up on the Thielsen tunnel. I'm gonna need your help
        to move that outta the way.

[Sarah's eyes are drawn to mutilated corpses hanging from a branch.]

Sarah: My God — what the hell is that?
Deacon: That is a sigil. It's a warning sign from the Rippers.
Sarah: What's a Ripper?

Deacon: Rippers. Rest in Peace, they were a cult. They cut themselves, they
        worshiped the Freaks, they wanted to be like them. And¹ um — you could
        see what happened if you didn't want to be like them.

Sarah: How do we deal with them if we run into 'em?
Deacon: We ain't gonna run into 'em. You gonna help me move this or what?
Sarah: Yeah, sure.

[They push a jeep out of the way to unblock the tunnel.]

Deacon: Okay, hang on — this is gonna be a tight squeeze —

Sarah: Jesus — no wonder everyone gave up their cars.

Deacon: This is nothin' — there's a tunnel up on the Old Belknap Road that
        Boozer and I rode through all the time — traffic had been backed up
        at a NERO checkpoint for about a mile when everything — got overrun —

Sarah: Sounds horrible.

Deacon: I've seen worse, but — yeah.

[Through the tunnel, they near the Cloverdale facility.]

Sarah: Hey, this looks familiar —
Deacon: Yeah, yeah — it's right up here.

[The pair reaches the front gate.]

Sarah: Wow. I never thought I'd see this place again.

[Deacon tosses a stick at the fence and sees it immediately electrocuted.]

Deacon: Okay, alright — the power's still on.

Sarah: Yeah — that doesn't surprise me. There's a solar array on the main
       rooftop. I think I also heard rumors about a nuclear-powered generator,
       but I never saw it.

Deacon: Okay — well¹ how the hell are we gonna get in?
Sarah: Here, I'll show you. Like you said, power's still on, right?

[She puts her hand on a biometric reader.]

Sarah: Sarah Irene Whitaker. ID 2007659.

AIRI: Good afternoon, Sarah Irene Whitaker. Welcome back to Cloverdale Research
      Iron Butte facility. It has been 751 days since your last login. Please
      wait.

Deacon: Well¹ you guys are a little more high tech than I remember.

Sarah: It's not really that impressive. AIRI's not intelligent — she's like a
       souped-up smartphone app.

Deacon: AIRI?
Sarah: Artificial Intelligent Response Interface.

[The gate slides open, revealing sprinklers watering fresh crops.]

Sarah: Oh my God!
Deacon: What is it?
Sarah: Nothing, it's —
Deacon: What the hell?
Sarah: Look at this — there's so much food here.
Deacon: Sarah, this should be dried up and —

Sarah: It — it's the irrigation system — it's all self-automated. So as long
       as the power's on, this is self-sustaining.

Deacon: Oh wow, well. Shit. This place has everything. It has food. It's got
        water. It's got power. It's got a big fucking fence. I'm surprised no
        one is, uh — Camped out here.

Sarah: It's like you said. The power's still on. That's — 8000 volts telling
       everyone to keep the fuck out. See? C'mon.

[They walk near some corn stalks.]

Sarah: Oh — Oh man —

[Suddenly, tons of crows swarm the area.]

Sarah: Oh! Shit!

Deacon: Get down — get down! Sarah — run! Run!

[An abandoned car's nearby.]

Deacon: Sarah! Go, go, go, go, go!

[They hide inside as the afflicated avians ram into the vehicle.]

Sarah: Oh shit —
Deacon: Oh — Goddamn crows. Goddamn crows.
Sarah: They're infected. It's what² made them so hyper-aggressive.
Deacon: It makes them a pain in my ass.
Sarah: I think we should be okay as long as we're quiet.
Deacon: Okay. C'mon.
Sarah: Alright.

[They exit in peace. Deacon looks at a nearby cars and old corpses.]

Deacon: What the hell happened here?
Sarah: I don't know.

Deacon: What? Sarah. These, uh — these people all worked here, right? Did you
        know them?

Sarah: Yeah. Yeah, I knew 'em. Let's go. C'mon.
Deacon: So someone shot them all, as they were, what, tryin' to leave?
Sarah: I mean, yeah, it looks like it.

Deacon: And then they just locked the place up tight and they left? Why would
        they do that?

Sarah: I don't know, Deacon. I dunno, I wasn't here.

[They walk closer to the main building. Sarah uses the scanning terminal.]

Sarah: Sarah Irene Whitaker. ID 2007659. Shit. This one's not working. Come
       on — there's another one over here.

Deacon: So, okay — so why is — um — what'd you call it? AIRI? Why is AIRI
        workin' at the front gate and not the front door?

Sarah: Honestly¹ I'm surprised she's working at all. I remember the guys in
       the IT department constantly complaining about the system going down —
       and that was with weekly maintenance — and now it's been¹ what, two
       years?

[The two to the facility's north side to try another terminal.]

Sarah: Goddammit. I — I don't understand why these aren't working.
Deacon: Hey¹ Sarah — you know how you said no one could get in here?
Sarah: Yeah — why?

[He nods to a surveillance cam nearby.]

Deacon: Maybe they're already here.

Sarah: Motherfucker. My God, you're right. They've locked me out. Hey! Hey,
       let us in! We're not here to hurt you. And we're not here to stay! Oh¹
       God — let us in!

Deacon: Well — is there another way in?

Sarah: Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. Come on. There's a fire escape in the back
       of the maintenance building.

Deacon: But why won't they have that locked out too?

Sarah: We don't know that "they've" locked out anything — I mean, it's probably
       just a glitch. The emergency exits can't be locked out — they're part of
       Cloverdale's security protocols.

[They walk to the facility's western side.]

Sarah: Here, this is it — I just have to figure out how to get up there —
Deacon: Hold on, hold on. Uh — I can shoot the latch —

[He snipes the latch holding the fire escape ladder in place.]

Sarah: Good shot — you done that before?
Deacon: Yeah, once or twice.

Deacon: Yeah, I don't know about this,¹ why don't you let me go in first —

Sarah: Look, I don't know what happened back there in the parking lot — But
       I'm telling you, there's no way anyone could've gotten past this fence.
       I know these people and if Jim's in there, he's gonna let us in —

Sarah: Sarah Irene Whitaker. ID 2007659.

AIRI: Good afternoon, Sarah Irene Whitaker. Welcome back to Cloverdale Research
      Iron Butte facility. It has been seven minutes since your last login.
      Please wait.

[The door opens.]

Sarah: See? I told you. Those other doors must've been bugged or something.
       Ready?

[As they stroll in proudly, they hear aggressive yelling and then gunshots.]

Deacon: C'mon. Get down.
Sarah: That motherfucker!
Deacon: You were sayin'?
Sarah: Yeah —

Deacon: Well¹ if this world has taught me one thing? Trust no one — expect the
        worst.

Sarah: Yeah, I'm beginning to see your point on that.

Deacon: Stay up here and give me covering fire. Do whatever you can to distract
        them.

Sarah: Got it.

Deacon: I'll signal you when it's clear.

Sarah: Hey, if you get a clear shot, will you shoot those Goddamn speakers.¹
       Her voice is driving me fucking crazy.

Deacon: I'm with you there.

[Sarah will try to distract the enemies if given the chance:]

Sarah: Hey, you — look, whoever's shooting — just stop. I have clearance to be
       here. You can check the computer. My name is Sarah Whitaker, Research
       Specialist — ID number 2007659. Will you check the Goddamn computer!¹
       Goddammit! Do you hear me? I have clearance! Find Jim Moore — he was
       head of security. If he's here, get him and bring him to me — he can
       vouch for me. Hey! Are you listening to me? I worked for Cloverdale — I
       can help you with the systems here. If you're Squatters and you don't
       know how the place works, I can show you.

[Eventually the enemies die.]

Deacon: It's clear.
Sarah: Coming. We gotta get up those stairs and through the sky bridge¹.
Deacon: Alright, I'm with you.

[They go to the skybridge's door.]

Sarah: It's locked. Hold on. Sarah Irene Whitaker. ID 2007659.

AIRI: Sarah Irene Whitaker. Security has been breached. The Cloverdale facility
      is in lockdown. Repeat —

Sarah: Override. ID 2007659. Override.
AIRI: Security protocol Alpha 761 has been overridden.

Sarah: Oh God — shut the fuck up already — they must not have locked out inner
       security. You ready?

Deacon: Yeah, this time? Let me go in first.
Sarah: Hey, this time — we go in together.

[They gun down two men hiding behind the security-locked door.]

Sarah: Shit — snipers. Up there on the roof.
Deacon: I see 'em — There's more of 'em —
Sarah: I see 'em —

[They clear out the skybridge area.]

Sarah: One more time — Sarah Irene Whitaker. 2007659. Security override, and
       disable the fucking voice response —

Deacon: What — well — ready¹ —
Sarah: Yeah —

[The skybridge door opens, just in time to see Jim Moore skidaddling ahead.]

Jim: They're through — they're through — get this Goddamn door locked out —
     NOW!

Sarah: Jim! Wait! That sonofabitch —
Deacon: Well, like you said — a lot's changed.
Sarah: Let's make sure it's clear —
Deacon: Yeah — on it —

[They search the empty office-cum-barracks.]

Sarah: It's clear in here —
Deacon: Nothin' here —
Sarah: It's clear —
Deacon: Same here — Okay, it's clear.

Sarah: They're waiting for us in the atrium. Come on, let's try the door. Sarah Irene Whitaker. ID 2007659. Security override — and disable the fucking
       voice response.

AIRI: Access denied. Sarah Irene Whitaker, your security clearance has been
      revoked. Please see an IT administrator for assistance.

Sarah: Oh, fuckin' bitch!

Deacon: Hey, hey. Goin' in that way would have been a death trap anyway. Every
        gun on the other side of that door is aimed right here. We need a
        better plan.

Sarah: Oh yeah, you got one?
Deacon: Uh, well — maybe? Uh — like — is there a way to that rooftop from here?

Sarah: Over here. Okay, there's a ledge out here. You should be able to climb
       up to the roof from that AC unit.

Deacon: You mean, you should be able to climb up from there. Listen, I want you
        to go up there — lay down suppressing fire. Keep their attention. When
        they're all looking up, I'm gonna go in from here — I'm gonna take 'em
        by surprise.

Sarah: Okay, yeah¹ that's a really good plan — but, uh — there's, uh — there's
       one problem with it —

Deacon: What's that?
Sarah: The door's locked down. Remember?
Deacon: Shit.
Sarah: Come on. Come on, I have an idea.
Deacon: What?

[They walk back inside to the office area.]

Sarah: Put your hand on that reader.
Deacon: Wait, what are you doing?

Sarah: Yes — I'm in. Okay, they locked out security, but they forgot the admin
       codes. From this station, I can get you a temporary access code.
       Alright, here's your ID code, ready?

Deacon: Uh, yeah?
Sarah: Your full name and ID 5429009. You got that?
Deacon: Uh — 5429009. Uh — is that right?
Sarah: Yeah, let's go.

[They walk back outside.]

Sarah: Here, I'm gonna need you to help me up.
Deacon: Okay — hold on.
Sarah: Ready?
Deacon: Yep.

[He boosts her onto the roof.]

Deacon: You got it?
Sarah: Yeah. Wait until I get their attention, then you go in.
Deacon: Hey — don't take any chances.
Sarah: You kidding me? These days — that's all I do.
Deacon: Okay, go.

[Soon, he can hear her ranting loudly to distract the gunmen ahead.]

Sarah: Jim Moore! I know you're in there — answer me, Goddammit! It's Sarah
       Whitaker — I worked here, remember? Jim! What the hell are you doing?
       Tell your men to stand down!

Jim: Up there! She's up there!
Sarah: Jim, it doesn't have to go down like this!
Jim: Oh shit — c'mon! Get her!
Sarah: Dammit¹ Jim, listen to me!
Jim: Oh, to hell with you! You should've left when you had the chance!
Deacon: Well — that's my cue —
Sarah: Dammit — shit!

[Deek uses the door terminal.]

Deacon: Deacon Lee St. John — ID 542900 — 9.

AIRI: Good morning, Deacon Lee St. John. Welcome to Cloverdale Research Iron
      Butte facility. This is your first login. Please —

Deacon: Disable voice response. Shut the fuck up — Okay. Here we go —

[The atrium is soon cleared.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em.
Sarah: Nope, there's one more. I saw Jim go scurrying into the office up there.
Deacon: Wait here. I'll bring him to you.

[He knocks the door open.]

Deacon: Hands! Hands! Get up!
Jim: Don't shoot! Don't shoot! I give up! I give up!
Sarah: Don't shoot him. We need him alive!
Deacon: Oh Goddammit, I said hands!

[Jim, unarmed, gets up.]

Jim: Alright, alright! Just — just tell me what you want —
Deacon: Okay. Alright.

[Deek pats him down.]

Deacon: He's clean. Get down there.
Jim: We were just defending ourselves —

[Jim and Sarah reunite downstairs.]

Sarah: All the dead people outside, Jim. You know, the ones you shot in the
       head.

Jim: I don't know what you're talking about —

Sarah: I mean, what was it, huh? What were they trying to do? Get home to their
       families, maybe bring them back here? But you didn't want that, did you?

Jim: We — just couldn't take — the risk.
Sarah: Get up.
Jim: Wait — wait, wait —

[He's brought to a nearby terminal.]

Jim: I can't. Don't make me.
Sarah: Jim, I'm gonna count to three.
Jim: No, no, no, no, no — You don't understand.
Sarah: One —
Jim: Look, don't do this!
Sarah: two — three! Open the Goddamned door!
Jim: Alright — alright!

[His credentials give access to the research lab.]

Jim: I hope you know what you're doing.
Sarah: Thank you, Jim. Yes, we know what we're doing.
Jim: You don't have to do this. Let me go.
Sarah: I'm sorry. We just can't take the risk.

[He lunges at her, but she blows his brains out.]

Sarah: C'mon. I wanna get the hell outta here.

[Sarah slowly walks through the expansive lab.]

Sarah: It's all true. I didn't want to believe it.
Deacon: What are you — talking about?
Sarah: God, this is my fault.
Deacon: I — I don't understand. Your — your fault?

Sarah: I should have seen it when it first went in. I mean, we used to grow
       wild ginger and — and grape root here. And then all of this changed.
       They sealed everything off, they took away my clearance. God, David
       kept telling me — he kept telling me that something was wrong.

Deacon: Okay, okay — who's — who's David? Slow —

Sarah: David Gorman — he was this research intern. You know what I said? I told
       him that we're pharm, and we're — we're — High tech and all that shit.
       And that there are billions of dollars at stake and to just leave it
       alone. Then he didn't listen. He hacked the system, he got behind the
       firewall — He told me that this was some sort of classified project or
       something, I don't know —

Deacon: Okay. Classified project, just slow down —

Sarah: He wanted — he wanted to be the next Edward Snowden. You see, he wanted
       to blow the lid off this entire thing — "David Gorman Exposes the Evil
       Empire and Saves the World" and all that shit. And I didn't listen to
       him, Deacon. I told him that he was being paranoid. And he must have
       broken in here and then gotten some sample — Of whatever the hell they
       were cooking in here.

Deacon: Well, wait — I don't understand. What do you mean?

Sarah: I pieced it together myself a little while later. That night that I was
       stabbed, I went to the Cloverdale office in Farewell — And I went to —
       to go try and find David, but he was already gone. He'd been gone for
       two weeks. There was this big Green Expo in Portland. He must have gone
       to see a reporter. He was probably infected and he didn't even know it
       yet.

Deacon: Oh my God —

Sarah: And two days later — two days later, everybody at that conference was
       infected. And then they all got on planes and they went home. And a week
       later, two and a half billion people were dead.

Deacon: Sarah¹ this isn't — this couldn't be your fault. I mean — you couldn't
        have stopped him,¹ how could you have stopped —

Sarah: You don't understand. It's — it's the research — my research was a part
       of this. Deacon, I was a part of this. They — they used me.

[After a good cry, Sarah and Deacon leave with the DNA sequencer.]

Deacon: Hey, uh — hold — hold on for a second.
Sarah: What's up?
Deacon: Uh — the electric fences. How would I turn 'em off?
Sarah: Uh — the power relays are in a building by the greenhouses. Why?

Deacon: Okay — um — it's just that there's a lot of food and I was thinking
        about radioing Boozer — Letting him and Rikki know — letting Lost Lake
        Camp know. Do you think you could load that up?

Sarah: Yeah — sure.
Deacon: Okay, uh — I'm gonna be right there.
Sarah: Okay.

[He walks to the greenhouses.]

Deacon: Uh — power building. Yeah, that's, uh — that's gotta be it. More crows.
        Dammit.

[He throws a molotov on the nests nearby.]

Deacon: That does it — burn¹ you little bastards. Now I just gotta jimmy that
        door — No time — no time — That did it.

[Switching the power off is an easy feat.]

Deacon: That should do it. Uh — Boozer, it's — it's Deacon. Come back. Lost
        Lake Camp, is anyone there?

Boozer: Deek? Deek — is that you?
Deacon: Yeah, Boozer, it's me.
Boozer: Hey! It is good to hear from you, brother.

Deacon: Good to hear from you too — listen, I don't — got a lot of time. Uh —
        The — the research facility that Sarah used to work at, the one near
        Iron Butte — The one near the Ripper — you know the one I'm talking
        about, right? So listen — there's food here. Lots of food — corn — so
        tell Rikki, tell Iron Mike — tell 'em to send someone —

Boozer: Wait — you found her? What — you found Sarah?
Deacon: Yeah. I found her, Boozeman. I found her.
Boozer: That is — awesome, Deek. When are you bringin' her back? To Lost Lake?
Deacon: No, I'm — I'm not gonna get into that right now.
Boozer: Deek?
Deacon: Yeah.
Boozer: Tell her — tell her — That you be safe. Okay? Be safe —
Deacon: Boozer? Boozer — Boozer? Lost Lake Camp, come in. Ah, dammit —
Rikki: Uh — Lost Lake, come in.
Deacon: Rikki. Okay, good, listen up. Uh —
Rikki: Deek?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah, it's me. Uh — listen. There's a —

Rikki: I didn't think we'd hear from you again. Iron Mike said you weren't
       coming back.

Deacon: Look — I don't have a lot of time. Listen, there's this —
Rikki: Did you find her?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah. I found her. Rikki?
Rikki: I'm glad, Deek. You were right. We made it. I'm glad she did too. Deek?

Deacon: Yeah, okay — listen. There's this farm, okay? Uh — there's, uh, power,
        it's got electrical fences —

Rikki: Electric fences — 'kay.

Deacon: And if you come here, it — ask Boozer — it's where Sarah used to work —
        Uh, by Iron Butte, he's gonna know the place. You come over here,
        you're gonna find food. You're gonna find lots of food.

Rikki: Okay.
Deacon: Uh — how's he doing?

Rikki: Oh — um, good, good. You'll never believe who Iron Mike made head of
       security.

Deacon: Are you kidding? Wow, that's great. Um — Could you tell — you know
        what. Listen, I gotta go, Rikki.

Rikki: Bye¹ Deek —

Deacon: Uh — you know what? Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second — Uh —
        that thing you said about, uh, lighting a candle? I think maybe you
        were right.

Rikki: I know. Rikki out.
Deacon: Bye¹ Rikki.

[Deek walks back to the gate.]

Kouri: St. John, this is Kouri. Where are you? One of my men reported that you
       went through his checkpoint at the Thielsen Pass.

Deacon: Yeah, Captain, uh — there's a research facility in Iron Butte — it's,
        um — it's like Sarah, uh — Lieutenant Whitaker — said, there's an
        important piece of equipment that she needed. And this was where — and
        this was the only place that she could get it.

Kouri: She's not answering her radio. The Colonel wants to know why you're not
       back yet.

Deacon: Tell him, uh — tell him we're on our way.
Kouri: Colonel wants to speak to you —

Deacon: Sorry¹ Captain — you're — breaking up. Uh — headin' out — right now.
        St. John out.

[Back at the bike, Sarah's already secured her tech.]

Sarah: Did — ah — you talk to him? To Boozer?

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I told him that you're fine and we're fine. And —
        That I had to get moving — Because we have to try and make it over
        the pass before the weather turns.

Sarah: What do you think?

[They look at the snowstorm on the horizon.]

Deacon: I don't know. This doesn't look good. But it's worth a try¹ so¹ uh —
        let's get moving.

[Later, they hole up in the Thielsen Pass cabin from earlier, avoiding the
 nasty weather.]

Deacon: It's clear.

[Later, Deek sits near the fire, sans soggy clothes.]

Deacon: Hey, you gonna come out and eat somethin'?

[She comes out in a similar state of undress.]

Sarah: Yeah, just as second. Everything I had is soaking wet. Excuse me. I
       never thought I'd — get warm again.

Deacon: Yeah.
Sarah: Um — did you wanna — eat something — or —
Deacon: Yeah. Yeah —
Sarah: Yeah? Okay.

[They reach for food near the fire, but pull back.]

Sarah: God, I'm not even hungry.

Deacon: Yeah, neither am I. You cold? Here, c'mere.

[They get intimate by the fire.]

[The next morning, they ride to town. Sarah gives him a kiss, thinking no
 one's looking, but Kouri sees it from afar. Soon after...]

Kouri: St. John. Come in.
Deacon: This is Corporal St. John. Uh — what's up, Captain?
Kouri: I need you to head back to Command — stat. Meet me at the infirmary.
Deacon: The infirmary? What's wrong?
Kouri: There's been — an incident.

Deacon: I'm on my way. Okay, what the hell? Uh — Lieutenant Whitaker? Uh — are
        you there? Dammit — Sarah? Come in. Sarah? Goddammit.

[If Deek exits Wizard Island, he can hear more truther nonsense:]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Before the
          shit went down, you talked about global conspiracy, most would've
          laughed you out of the room. No one's laughin' now. We know this went
          worldwide. We saw it in India, South America. What we didn't know —
          is that the Trilateral Commission had a hand in it. You know about
          those guys — an NGO that wants North America, Western Europe, and
          Japan to quote foster cooperation unquote. Yeah, they fostered
          something. You know they picked the places that got hit first. But
          someone betrayed America. And don't think I'm giving the United
          Nations a walk here either. They've been giving terrorist nations a
          seat at the table for years. Could be, the UN is out there running
          just fine without us, and one of our former "friends" has a seat on
          the Security Council. Think about it. NERO's got a clear hand in
          this, but they'd need a lot of help to start this war. This is Mark
          Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe the lies.

Deacon: Who knows¹ Cope, maybe you're right for a change. If you had any idea
        what they were cooking inside Cloverdale — in your own Goddamned
        backyard — you'd have a heart attack.

[Deek heads over to Jiminez's tent to find a crime scene. Kouri is talking to
 sentries.]

Kouri: Go, now.
Deacon: Hey, what's going on? Captain?
Kouri: Doctor Jiminez has been murdered.
Deacon: What?
Kouri: And the sonofabitch slit his throat from here to here.
Deacon: Jesus Christ. Where's Taylor — did — did — did Taylor see anything?
Kouri: All narcotics in the camp are gone.
Deacon: Taylor —
Kouri: This one's on me. I assigned him to the infirmary.

Deacon: No, no, no — that's not what I'm saying, I'm saying Taylor was a
        junkie.

Kouri: You knew? It doesn't matter anymore.

[Kouri leaves solemnly.]

[Deek rides outside of town.]

Deacon: Captain Kouri. Come in. Corporal St. John to Captain Kouri.
Kouri: This is Kouri.
Deacon: Hey, uh — I'm gonna go after Taylor.
Kouri: Several patrols have already been sent out. The Colonel's furious.
Deacon: Yeah, I'll bet. The doc was a good guy.
Kouri: Captain Jiminez — was the only doctor we had.

Deacon: Look, Taylor mentioned somethin' about headin' up to the ski lodge.
        I'm gonna go there and see if I can find him.

Kouri: Radio me if you do. And Corporal — the Colonel wants Taylor alive.
Deacon: Yeah — copy that. St. John out.

[Deek rides for the ski lodge Taylor once mentioned to him.]

Weaver: St. John, you there?
Deacon: Yeah, Weaver — I'm here.

Weaver: Uh — hey, call me Jim, man. Listen, I never said thank you — for
        helping me out, I mean.

Deacon: Ahh, look, I — I'm — just followin' orders.

Weaver: Well — I'm gonna thank you anyway. I really appreciate you goin' out
        in the shit, riskin' your neck for me. And¹ dude, this napalm shit's
        almost good to go. We're gonna need you to help test it pretty soon.

Deacon: Yeah, sure, Weaver — uh — Jim. Yeah, I'll be around. Deacon out.

[The ski lodge comes into sight. A frosted-over Militia bike is nearby.]

Deacon: Alright¹ Taylor. What the hell are you doin' out here? This is it —
        Which way — There you are. I gotta find a way inside.

[When the Marauders are dead, Deek finds Taylor slumped near a fireplace.]

Deacon: Taylor?
Taylor: Deacon St. John.
Deacon: How're we doin', Taylor?

Taylor: I fucked up, man. I didn't mean to kill him, man. He wasn't supposed
        to be there, I — Doc was a good guy, man. He fuckin' — he fuckin'
        helped me, he helped me.

Deacon: C'mon, get up —

Taylor: No — I don't wanna hang, man — I don't wanna hang. I don't wanna hang.
        I can't — I don't wanna hang. You — you —

Deacon: Hey, listen to me, Taylor — Taylor — Wade —

Taylor: You kick and you kick and you shit yourself, all those fucks standin'
        at attention. And they're laughin' at you — They're laughin' at you —
        I don't wanna hang — I don't wanna hang — Please — don't let them hang
        me —

[There's a noise outside.]

Taylor: Fuck — Fuck — Please, man —
Deacon: Okay¹ Wade —

[Deek picks up a hypodermic and shows it to Taylor, who nods. After Deacon
 injects him in the neck, the fatal overdose works quickly. Soon, Kouri walks
 in.]

Kouri: St. John?
Deacon: In here. Overdose.
Kouri: Goddammit. Bring the body outside.

[Soon, Taylor's corpse is dumped in a pile with the other Marauders outside.]

Kouri: I don't care what a man's done. We never leave them for the Freaks.

[He throws a molotov on the pile.]

Kouri: I can tell you right now — Colonel's not gonna be happy about this.

[The two pull back into camp later. Garret is waiting.]

Garret: Well?
Kouri: When we found him, he was already dead. Overdose.
Deacon: We recovered most of the drugs. Not all.

Garret: As if the world hasn't seen enough corruption and decay. As if the
        world isn't already filled to overflowing with mindless, soulless
        creatures. Take these to the infirmary. And this time assign someone
        who isn't a Goddamn junkie.

Kouri: Yessir.

[Garret looks at Deacon before walking off.]

[Later, while out riding...]

Sarah: Deacon, are you there? Deacon, it's Sarah, I need to talk to you —
Deacon: Uh, yeah, hey — I'm here. You sound — kinda cheerful.

Sarah: Well, I had a breakthrough. Look, all I needed was that DNA sequencer —
       I'm ready to test it. Deacon, I'm ready to test my serum.

Deacon: Wow — okay, um — what do you need from me?
Sarah: I'll tell you when you get here. Sarah out.

[He returns to her tent in town the next morning.]

Deacon: Wait, hold up — you want one alive?
Sarah: Kind of hard to run tests on something dead. Here.

[She hands him a weird-looking sidearm.]

Deacon: What — what — what is that?

Sarah: It's a special tranquilizer,¹ it'll help you knock it out long enough so
       you can bring it back here. I am so close, Deacon. This could be it.

Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am.

[Deek rides out of Wizard Island.]

Sarah: Deacon, come in —
Deacon: Hey, I was just headin' out to find you a Newt.
Sarah: Great! Okay, there's a specific one that I need, alright?
Deacon: Whoa, wait — hold on for a second — a specific Newt?

Sarah: South of here, just off Rim Drive, is an old resort cabin — it — it's
       now home to an entire colony of infected kids — Newts —

Deacon: Okay —
Sarah: Okay — so radio me when you get there. Sarah out.
Deacon: A colony of Newts. Oh my God, this I gotta see.

[Soon after Sarah radios in...]

Kouri: St. John, report.

Deacon: Hey¹ Captain — I'm on a run for Lieutenant Whitaker — so I'm kinda busy
        at the moment.

Kouri: Understood. Report to me when you're finished. We're ready to test
       Weaver's weapon. Kouri out.

Deacon: Oh, shit — well, so much for Sarah beatin' Weaver to the finish line.

[Deek goes to the roadside cabin overlooking the Crater Lake rim.]

Deacon: Sarah, I'm here.

Sarah: Alright, you're looking for a young female wearing a red shirt, one of
       those kids¹ shirts that says, "Teensy Tabby" or something.

Deacon: I'm surprised the Colonel hasn't burned this place out yet —

Sarah: I told Matt the site is hands-off. I've been running blood tests on
       several of the youngest ones for months. I need them for this serum.

Deacon: Um, okay — uh, how am I supposed to get the one you want without
        killing the rest?

Sarah: Look, I don't know¹ just — just do what you have to do, okay? I need the
       female wearing the red shirt.

[Deek tranqs the red-shirted Newt.]

Deacon: I got you, you little shit — oh — Jesus —

[He loads the brat onto his bike.]

Deacon: You wanted a live one — you get a live one.

[As he pulls into town near Kouri, he finds the Newt had an accident.]

Deacon: Ah — fuckin' — Jesus Christ — Uh, hey¹ Captain — uh — pissed all over
        my bike —

Kouri: Uh — the Colonel doesn't allow for pets on the island, I'm afraid.
Deacon: Uh — Lieutenant needed a live test subject.
Kouri: Ah, you two seem to be getting along well. You and Lieutenant Whitaker.
Deacon: Just — doin' my job, sir.

Kouri: Yeah¹ well, keep it professional, Corporal. The Colonel doesn't allow
       for fraternization between enlisted men and officers.

Deacon: Oh, no, no — can't have any of that, sir.
Kouri: Right. Carry on.
Deacon: Yessir.

[Kouri leaves.]

Deacon: Okay, uh —

[He takes the Newt back to Sarah's tent, just as it starts coming around.]

Deacon: Come on, help me —
Sarah: Hold on, hold on —
Deacon: So much for your tranquilizer —

Sarah: Yeah, well¹ their biology is kinda fucked right now,¹ what do you want
       me to do? I can't get the right dosage. Here, hold on, hold that —

Deacon: Got it.

[The Newt is now hooked up to Sarah's IV bag.]

Sarah: Alright. This is it. This is what I've been working on.
Deacon: How long?
Sarah: Hold on, just a few seconds. Hold 'em — what?

[The struggling newt relaxes as it suddenly dies, blood leaking everywhere.]

Deacon: Oh shit. Holy shit. Goddamn. Well, I don't know what you put in that,
        but that shit went down fast.

Sarah: Oh — Goddammit!

Deacon: Wait, you — you're — you're not makin' a bio-weapon. You're — Oh my
        God, are you — are you — are you trying to cure it?

Sarah: I thought, that once I got the original cell line from Cloverdale — That
       I could create antibodies from the virus, and I could reverse¹ engineer
       it —

Deacon: Jesus.

Sarah: And now all of that work, everything that I have worked on is for
       nothing. I can't save them. Nothing's gonna be able to change them back.

Deacon: So get up. Dust yourself off. Try again.

Sarah: Were you not seeing what just happened? Every cell in that kid's body
       just exploded —

Deacon: That's exactly why you can't quit.
Sarah: What?

Deacon: Because you called it a "kid." Do you have any idea how many of these
        things that I've killed? And it never once occured to me, you know
        what? That used to be someone's kid. You know I met this girl once,
        and she used to talk about the Freakers the same way you do. She used
        to call them "sick people." I thought that was crazy — But she looks
        at them the same way that you do.

Sarah: So you think I'm crazy —

Deacon: No. No. I think you're the first sane person I've seen in two years.
        You know I still remember the night that I lost you, but — I'm starting
        to realize, it wasn't the night that I left you on that chopper. It was
        the next night. Me and Boozer, we rode into that refugee camp, that you
        were supposed to be waiting at, right? Except there's Freakers
        everywhere, the choppers are on fire, there's people screaming. So many
        people. And so we fought. And we won. And what do we get? Bodies.
        Bodies everywhere. And I checked every corpse, every face. There musta
        been a thousand of them — maybe more. I checked every single one. That
        was the night that I lost you. And, Boozer — Boozer¹ you know, he —
        he just — he was just trying — To keep me together for the next two
        years, but I didn't a shit about any of it. And then I see this NERO —
        chopper flying around in the sky — And I started to feel something,¹
        I'm thinking, you know what? Fuck you. Fuck you. Because even if she
        is alive, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna find her, we're gonna
        ride away, we're never gonna look back. Because I don't wanna be part
        of some Militia, I don't wanna fight in a war. And I don't wanna live
        in some camp.

Sarah: So why are you still here?

Deacon: Because of you. All of this. Seeing how hard you work, seeing how
        dedicated you are. Most people out there, they're just trying to
        survive and here you are — Trying to save the Goddamn world.

Sarah: Yeah¹ well, I'm not doing a very good job.

Deacon: So you get up. Dust yourself off. And you try again. We're going back
        to Cloverdale. They got better equipment. We're gonna dig into their
        research deeper.

Sarah: You would do that? You would help me?
Deacon: Yeah¹ I would. I would because you believe in this. Don't give up.

Sarah: We'll ride north — Yeah, we'll ride north, we'll — we'll tell them that
       we're going on a supply run.

Deacon: Yeah, but we're not coming back.
Sarah: No, we're gonna go AWOL. You know if they catch us, they will hang us.
Deacon: Then we hang together.

[Just then, a soldier enters.]

Soldier: Ma'am.
Sarah: Yeah —
Soldier: Deek? Colonel wants to see you.
Deacon: Be right there.

[The soldier leaves.]

Deacon: Pack up what you need. I'll be back.
Sarah: Thank you.
Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am.

[As he leaves the tent, Garret walks by.]

Garret: Corporal St. John.
Deacon: Colonel — sir.
Garret: Come with me, please.

[They visit Weaver near the motor pool.]

Garret: Are we ready?
Weaver: Colonel, sir. Yes¹ sir. That shit is locked and loaded.
Kouri: Bike's already loaded, sir.
Deacon: Uh — Not sure if I — understand.
Garret: Lieutenant Weaver's weapon is finished. We're ready to test it.
Weaver: Hell yeah.
Kouri: Are you ready to burn down a Horde?

[He gives them a look of utter disbelief.]

Garret: Something wrong, Corporal?
Deacon: No¹ sir. No, no, no, um — Hell yeah. Let's get this done.
Weaver: Alright. Now you're talkin', man.

Garret: Gentlemen — This is the start of a new era. Carry on. Lieutenant
        Weaver, with me!

Weaver: Yes¹ sir.

[Kouri and Deek ride to a ridge overlooking a Horde's gas station.]

Kouri: Alright. I figure that we should —
Deacon: I think you should stay up here and let me do this alone.
Kouri: What the fuck, you got a death wish?

Deacon: No. That's why I think I should go in alone. Look, even with Weaver's
        jacked¹ up Molotovs, we can't take an entire Horde all at once. No. So,
        uh. I — I figure I go down there — I get their attention, I pull off a
        few at a time, and then I run like hell, and I gotta find some way to —
        slow 'em down, maybe set a few traps. And then I blow 'em to hell.
        Look. Two of us runnin' around down there, it's gonna be chaos — We'll
        just pull the Horde down on each other. No. You stay up here. You keep
        an eye on me. If shit goes south, you ride in there and you get me the
        hell out. Hm? Unless you got a better plan —

Kouri: I got nothing. I've got more Molotovs — ammo — in my saddlebags.
Deacon: Good, good. Uh — shit's gonna come in handy.

[Deek descends towards the Chemult gas station.]

Kouri: Tell me your plan again?

Deacon: Like I said — find a way to slow 'em down. The sonsofbitches like to
        clump up, climb all over each other. If I can find a narrow space,
        between trucks, buildings, whatever, it'll take 'em awhile to get
        through, and once I get some space between me and them —

Kouri: You'll blow 'em the hell up.
Deacon: You got it. Rinse, repeat — a few times, no more Horde.
Kouri: That's your plan.
Deacon: That's my plan.
Kouri: Good luck, St. John.
Deacon: Luck's got nothing to do with it. Alright, I'm headin' in —
Kouri: I see you — let me know if you need my help.
Deacon: Copy that.

[Deek thins the herd a bit.]

Deacon: How's it looking, Captain?
Kouri: It looks like you got about a quarter of them — keep it up!
Deacon: I'm trying —
Kouri: It works! Weaver's Molotov works! I can see the flames from here!
Deacon: That it does — more to come!

[Deek gets into the slaughter.]

Deacon: Going down — yeah —
Kouri: Light 'em up! I can see 'em from here!

[After more finesse...]

Kouri: St. John — it looks like you're down to about half of them — keep going!
Deacon: I'm on it — Come on¹ you sonsofbitches —

Deacon: Kouri — how am I doing?
Kouri: You're almost there, Corporal — maybe a quarter to go.

[More slaughter ensues...]

Kouri: Move, St. John — move!
Deacon: You don't gotta tell me!

[Finally, most of the herd is reduced to stragglers.]

Deacon: Kouri — please, please just tell me that's all of 'em.
Kouri: I can't believe it — you did it. You wiped out an entire Horde.
Deacon: Yeah — no problem! No problem.

[Deek starts returning to the ridge.]

Deacon: Sarah — are you there? Lieutenant Whitaker, this is Corporal St. John
        reporting in — come back. Ah, where the hell are you? Captain — uh, I
        just tried to check in with Lieutenant Whitaker — and she's not
        answering —

Kouri: Couldn't wait to tell her the good news?
Deacon: Yeah — she'll be thrilled.

Kouri: I bet. You'll see her soon enough. Don't radio Lieutenant Weaver. I
       want to tell him the news in person.

Deacon: Okay, you earned that — copy that. St. John out.

[Finally, Deek makes it back to the bikes.]

Kouri: We did it. You did it!
Deacon: Weaver did it. Oh —

Kouri: I've never seen anything like this. I mean, the way you were one step
       ahead of 'em?

Deacon: Ever had a Horde breathin' down your neck? It really keeps the
        adrenaline flowin'.

Kouri: Maybe the Colonel's right. Maybe we can win this war.

[The pair returns to Wizard Island.]

Weaver: Hey. How'd it go?

Kouri: Well¹ I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

Weaver: Oh shit. It didn't work?

Kouri: I'm sorry, Lieutenant — but you're out of a job. Hell yeah, it worked.

Weaver: Oh — yeah?!

Deacon: You should've been there, man. We really lit 'em up.

Weaver: Oh man!

Kouri: We're gonna celebrate tonight! The officer's mess.

Weaver: Alright, looks like somebody's getting a promotion. Hey man, you
        coming?

Deacon: Uh, you know what? Let me — I'm gonna catch up with ya. I gotta — I
        gotta take care of something first.

Weaver: Alright, you handle that.

[Deek goes to Sarah's tent and finds her things being moved.]

Garret: That's the last of it. Be careful not to break anything. Some of these
        things are — irreplaceable.

Deacon: What's going on? Um, where is the Lieutenant?

Garret: Corporal St. John.

Deacon: I'm sorry, sir.

Garret: It's alright¹ son. All essential personnel doing R&amp;D have been moved.

Deacon: Moved? Where? Uh — because I need to deliver these supplies that she
        asked for.

Garret: I understand. There's — been a — Walk with me, son. Please.

[He leads her into the Ark where Sarah is under guard in her new lab.]

Soldier: Ma'am, Colonel's orders.

Sarah: Matt, you can't do this. You can't keep me locked in here!

Garret: At ease, Captain. "And then the Lord said to Noah, enter the ark, you
        and your household — For you alone I have seen to be righteous before
        Me in this time."

Sarah: What — Matt, what are you talking about?

Garret: I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

[Garret leaves.]

Sarah: You can't — Colonel, wait!

Deacon: Hey!

Sarah: It's fine. It's fine.

Deacon: Ma'am, I got the, uh, supplies that you asked for.

Sarah: Come on in, follow me. I've been working on a new assignment. Poison
       this time. Listen. When you pick this, you have to do it carefully. If
       you don't, it could kill you.

Deacon: Understood — 

[He then says quietly, to avoid the nearby guard's ears:]

Deacon: I'm gonna get you outta here.

Sarah: Thank you.

Deacon: Yes¹ ma'am.

Deacon: Hey, Sarah? You there? Come in.

Sarah: Corporal St. John — I won't tolerate insubordination. Private — I'm
       trying to work. Get out.

Soldier: Sorry¹ ma'am, Colonel's orders. Gotta keep eyes on your twenty-four
         seven.

Deacon: Uh — Lieutenant — sorry. Yeah — just reporting in — um — I got a
        question about your requisition form —

Sarah: Yes, Corporal.
Deacon: Uh — it says that you need me to collect — water hemlock —

Sarah: Yes — it grows along the edges of wetlands — look along the north edge
       of the Klamath Marsh — you should be able to find it there.

Deacon: Klamath Marsh. Got it.

Sarah: Remember, Corporal — it's highly poisonous — the most toxic plant that
       grows in North America.

Deacon: Oh — okay. I'll be careful.

Sarah: And the last report said that there were infected crows in the area —
       so you might want to take something to burn out their nests.

Deacon: Burn out their nests. Got it. Uh — one more thing — uh — that other
        project — that I'm workin' on? I'm gonna have more information on that
        soon.

Sarah: Thank you, Corporal. Lieutenant Whitaker out.

Deacon: I'm gonna need some shotgun ammo — Burn out their nests — gonna need
        Molotovs —

[As Deek rides for the marsh, he hears a convo snippet from Lost Lake.]

Rikki: This is Rikki to Lost Lake — come back.
Boozer: Yeah, Rikki — what's up¹ —
Deacon: Rikki! Boozer? Can you hear me? Deacon to Lost Lake Camp — come back —
Rikki: Just, uh — checkin' in to see what else Addy needed — she —
Boozer: Goddammit, Rikki — I don't know. Oh, Iron Mike said —
Deacon: Boozeman? Rikki? Give 'em hell, Boozeman. Give 'em hell.

[Eventually he reaches the destination.]

Deacon: Okay, this pretty much looks like a — marsh — let's go look. And here's
        some more — More hemlock — more hemlock — need more hemlock — Okay,
        just a few more — I gotta find more — That should do it —

[He returns to Sarah's lab, only to be stopped by a guard.]

Deacon: Well, would you like to taste it? Go right ahead.

Sarah: Thank you¹ Corporal. I hope you were careful, this is very toxic.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. Sure thing, ma'am. Uh — listen, I got a plan. I don't have
        time to explain. But the next time I get here, get ready to get the
        hell out of here. Okay?

Sarah: Corporal —

[She hands him another requisition form.]

Sarah: I didn't thank you this time.

[He walks past the annoying guard.]

Deacon: As you were.

[Outside, he looks at the req form -- it says "I never stopped loving you".]

Weaver: Oh, Corporal St. John. Come on in, man. Check out my — home sweet home.
Deacon: Yeah, love what you've done with the place. I —

Weaver: Man, ain't this some shit? Wonder what they would've done with me if I

Deacon: Oh — colder cave, down that way.

[He points vaguely toward Sarah's lab.]

Weaver: Yeah, I heard about that. Y'know, she didn't take it any better than I

Deacon: No, she did not. Do you need anything?

Weaver: Nah, man. I'm good. Oh wait, you know what? There is something you can

Deacon: Hear what?

Weaver: That's right. Nothin'. Colonel ain't exactly big on tunes, in case you
        hadn't heard. I think he's a Mennonite or some shit.

Deacon: No, that's dancing.
Weaver: Wait¹ what's — dancing?

Deacon: The Mennonites, they love music,¹ they just have a problem with —
        dancing. Forget it, it's —

Weaver: Oh, no shit. Yeah, whatever¹ dude. I don't care. I need an MP3 player.
        Earbuds — anything. Sounds!

Deacon: Are you kidding me?
Weaver: Do I look like I'm kiddin'?
Deacon: Okay.
Weaver: Thank you.

[Deek rides out of Wizard Island on his MP3 player search.]

Weaver: St. John — you there?
Deacon: Weaver — yeah. I can barely hear you, though. You're breakin' up.

Weaver: It's this damn cave, man — I'm surprised a signal gets out at all. Hey,
        I know where you can find an mp3 player.

Deacon: Okay — yeah — where's that?
Weaver: I was at a refugee camp at a community college when it got overrun —
Deacon: Community college — uh — the one east of here, off Highway 97?

Weaver: Yeah, that's the one. Home of the Fighting Platypus, or some shit.
        Yeah, anyway, when I bugged out, I left everything behind, including
        my tunes. Oh — shit, I gotta go. Radio me when you get there. Weaver
        out.

Deacon: Uh, sure — Weaver — whatever you say.

Deacon: Weaver, I'm here.

Weaver: St. John — alright, man. Hey, hey — I was housed in some kind of tent
        —it¹ was like, right in the middle of camp.

Deacon: Okay — uh — can you tell me anything else? I mean, c'mon — these all
        kinda look the same.

Weaver: Wait — wait, wait, wait, wait — uh — yeah! Yeah — yeah — it was near a
        flag pole, a big one — yeah, flyin' the good ol' stars and stripes.

Deacon: Very patriotic. Alright, well — I'll have a look. St. John out.

[Deek heads east of the campus to the sports grounds' refugee camp.]

Deacon: Here they are — it's gotta be it. This is it — There's the flag — still
        flying. Here — here it is. I hope it's worth all this trouble, Weaver.

[He returns to Weaver's cave.]

Deacon: Hey —
Weaver: Hey¹ man, how'd you do?
Deacon: Ah, this is all I could find.

Weaver: Oh. Oh man, what do we have here? Oh! Brother! You're a lifesaver,

Deacon: Right on.
Weaver: Thank you!

Deacon: O'Brian? Come in, O'Brian —  I know you're on this channel.

O'Brian: Drifter? I didn't think I'd ever hear from you again, the radio's
         been dead —

Deacon: Yeah, I turned it off. Look, I need your help.
O'Brian: I'm listening —
Deacon: My wife — the woman you helped me track down —
O'Brian: I remember.
Deacon: Well, I found her, O'Brian. She's alive.
O'Brian: That's — incredible. The odds of her making it out —

Deacon: No, look — I don't have time — look. I found her, she's alive, but
        she's being held — by — uh — the Militia, the guys that you told me
        about.

O'Brian: I'm sorry.

Deacon: Okay, look — I don't need your Goddamn sympathy — I need your help.
        She's being held — in a place — I can't get to her. I need you to help
        me to break her out.

O'Brian: You know I can't do that — wait a second — Okay. But there's something
         you have to do for us first.

Deacon: You name it — I will do anything.
O'Brian: Keep your radio on this time. I'll be in touch.
Deacon: Okay, O'Brian — O'Brian! Oh, dammit.

[Later...]

O'Brian: Drifter — are you there?
Deacon: O'Brian — okay — where the hell have you been?
O'Brian: Meet me at the coordinates I've just transmitted. O'Brian out.
Deacon: O'Brian? O'Brian? Oh, Jesus, he's — dammit.

[Deek follows the coordinates to the snowy mountains.]

Deacon: So, uh, what do you want from me, O'Brian?
O'Brian: I'm glad she's alive, your wife.
Deacon: Okay, what — what do you want?

O'Brian: I told you the infected — the Freaks — are mutating. Some faster than
         others.

Deacon: Uh-huh.

O'Brian: We placed a tracking bracelet on one of them — So that we could track
         it, and stop it periodically, and draw blood samples, and — Check the
         progress of the virus.

Deacon: Okay, so why do you need me?
O'Brian: Well¹ it's wandered into Militia territory.
Deacon: Ahh — right.
O'Brian: We can't get close to it.
Deacon: Yeah. No fly¹ zone. Outposts with RPGs.
O'Brian: Exactly.

[He hands Deacon a rectangular satchel.]

Deacon: What's this?

O'Brian: Once you've tracked it down, I'm gonna need you to do something for
         me. This pack holds everything you need to do a field biopsy. We need
         blood and tissue samples. Can you handle that?

Deacon: Yeah, I can figure it out.
O'Brian: By the way. Nice uniform, Corporal. Suits you.
Deacon: Suck it.

[O'Brian leaves, but radios in soon after.]

O'Brian: The tracking signal is coming from somewhere around Mt. Scott. There's
         a cave. The subject you're tracking has a super elevated metabolism.
         We think it might be headed there. There's something else we'd like
         you to check — We did send a team in — on foot. They never came back.
         Just — let me know if you find 'em. We got people here looking for
         some closure.

Deacon: So, uh — what else can you tell me about this Freak you're trackin'?

O'Brian: We don't have all the answers. All we know is the infected are
         mutating. We're talking about leaping past millions of years of
         evolution. We think they're communicating with each other the way
         ants, and bees, and — and other —

Deacon: Y'know — to me, it sounds like a whole lotta mumbo jumbo.

O'Brian: Believe what you want. Once you see our test subject, you'll change
         your mind. O'Brian out.

[Deek travels to the Ice Wind Lava Cave near Mt. Scott.]

Deacon: O'Brian, I'm at the cave and I'm headin' in. You guys gonna be ready?

O'Brian: What's wrong?

Deacon: Freaker shit — Freaker shit everywhere. Hey¹ O'Brian — uh — you got
        any idea what took out your men? Am I walking into a Horde here?

O'Brian: No idea. We never heard back from them. Remember, if you find them,
         we got people here who'd be grateful.

Deacon: Grateful, grateful, yeah¹ that changes everything. Yeah — I got it.
        Good. I'll take care of it. Out. O'Brian — how many men are in here?
        Uh, how many did — did you lose?

O'Brian: Four.
Deacon: Four men.
O'Brian: A researcher and three soldiers.
Deacon: Jesus, O'Brian. What am I doin' in here?

O'Brian: The researcher — Coop — is a personal friend of mine. You do this,
         and I'll do whatever I can to help you get your wife. O'Brian out.

[Deek heads inside.]

Deacon: O'Brian — so while I'm tracking down your pet Freak, give me some more
        mumbo jumbo. Uh — tell me about the virus. I mean, somethin' that I
        don't know.

O'Brian: For those exposed, the virus infection rate is close to 100%. In the
         first weeks, almost everyone under the age of twelve was killed.
         Something to do with how puberty, or the lack of it, affected the
         body's immune response. Everyone over the age of sixty, mostly, were
         also killed. Their bodies just couldn't handle the rapid genetic
         mutations on a cellular level. Everyone else who is exposed becomes
         transformed as the genes mutate. The thing is — the virus is mutating
         at an exponential rate.

Deacon: I know, you keep saying that. What does that mean?

O'Brian: It means that the infected subject — the Freaker you're tracking down
         — isn't like any you've seen before. We've tracked and identified over
         twelve mutations.

Deacon: Twelve.

O'Brian: Yeah. And that's just the beginning. You wouldn't believe some of the
         shit we've seen.

Deacon: Yeah, well — I probably would. St. John out.

[A short ways into the cave...]

Deacon: A flare. Shit, that's gotta be one of O'Brian's men. Uh — hey¹ you, up
        there! Can you hear me? O'Brian — I see one of your men.

O'Brian: Is he — alive?

Deacon: I don't know,¹ he's not answering. And, uh — he's on a ledge above me.
        I'll see if I can get up to him.

O'Brian: If you can, retrieve his ID badge.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah. I'll get right on that. St. John out. How the hell am I
        gonna get up there?

[He looks at some tracks.]

Deacon: Guys in yellow spacesuits — can't be too hard to find 'em if they're
        in here — NERO equipment — musta, well, come this way. Maybe this way —

[He tries to get up to the first-spotted soldier and succeeds.]

Deacon: Another flare — yeah, this has to be the way. O'Brian, I, uh — I
        reached your guy and, uh — yeah. He's dead. ID says G. Hernandez.

O'Brian: How did it happen?

Deacon: Well, I'm not a coroner, O'Brian. How the hell do I know? Somethin' —
        tore him apart. This Freak I'm trackin' — is there somethin' you
        haven't told me?

O'Brian: Not that I'm aware of. O'Brian out.

[He soon finds a second corpse and observes the scene.]

Deacon: What the hell was that? He went down fast. O'Brian, I found another one
        of your men. ID says his name was H.S. Patterson.

O'Brian: Okay. Thanks for letting me know.
Deacon: You didn't ask, O'Brian.
O'Brian: Didn't ask what?
Deacon: If he was alive or dead.

O'Brian: His radio's been dead for twelve hours. All their radios have been
         dead for twelve — hours. I don't need to ask. Thank you for doing
         this. O'Brian out.

[He keeps spelunking in almost pitch darkness.]

Deacon: How am I gonna get to him? Another flare — gotta be another one of
        O'Brian's men. Hello! Can you hear me? Move an arm or something, if you
        can hear me! Move an arm — nope. Just gotta find a way over there.

[Deek hops a guide railing to find another flare.]

Deacon: Down there maybe.

[He soon finds a third corpse.]

Deacon: What the hell hit you? You didn't even see it coming. O'Brian, I, uh —
        found another one. ID says his name was Robinson.

O'Brian: Okay. Thanks. I'll — let his family know.

Deacon: So you guys have, uh — families. Managed to get 'em all out while shit
        was going down?

O'Brian: I'm not gonna apologize for being — lucky — luckier than most. Yes,
         some of us got our families out. Not many, but — some.

Deacon: That's just — that's so great, O'Brian. Good for you.
O'Brian: We didn't ask for this.
Deacon: Yeah — neither did anyone else.

[Deek sets off to find Cooper.]

Deacon: There's the last one —

O'Brian: Cooper, are you there? Is anyone there? NERO Team Bravo, come in. This
         is Commander James O'Brian — respond — if you are receiving this
         transmission. Coop — answer me —

Deacon: A NERO radio — this way.

[He observes another blood trail.]

Deacon: Must be Cooper — what the hell were you doing down here, man?

[He climbs into a wide-open space with lots of bones and blood spatter.]

Deacon: Yeah — that doesn't look good. Oh, shit — what the hell happened?
        O'Brian, I found your last man. ID reads Cooper.

O'Brian: Copy that.

[Suddenly, Cooper's body spasms to life.]

Cooper: Oh no —
Deacon: Oh Jesus.
Cooper: No, no!

Deacon: Hold on, he's still alive. Hold on — hey, Cooper, Cooper — Hey, hey,
        hey, hey, hey — right here, right here! We're gonna get you outta here,
        alright¹ pal?

O'Brian: Cooper? Cooper, come in.
Cooper: Sorry — shit — went south. Team's down.
Deacon: C'mon.

[He's in too much pain to help up.]

Deacon: Oh, Jesus.
O'Brian: What's going on? Deacon? Cooper?
Deacon: His legs are broken.
O'Brian: Hold on, stay with him. I'm sending in another team.

Cooper: No! No, no — My suit's compromised — I'm not gonna make it. Let me
        talk to Jean.

Deacon: Hey —
O'Brian: Get Jenn in here, now!
Deacon: Cooper, what the hell did this to you? What happened?
Cooper: It moved so fast. Didn't — didn't see — see it coming —
Deacon: Are you telling me that a Freak did all of this?
Cooper: Reacher — The Reacher —
Jenn: Cooper? Cooper, are you there?!
Cooper: Jenn?
Jenn: Uh-huh — I'm here — I can hear you —
Cooper: I can't believe it — I thought I'd never hear your voice — again —

Jenn: Coop — listen to me. We're gonna get you out of there — do you hear me?
      Coop — Coop —

Cooper: Jenn, I'm so glad I got to hear your — voice —
Jenn: Coop? Coop?! No — no!

[Cooper succumbs to his injuries.]

O'Brian: Jenn, come on —
Jenn: Let go of me! Let — Get your hands off me!
O'Brian: Get her outta here!
Deacon: He's gone.
O'Brian: Copy that. O'Brian out.
Deacon: Reacher —

[He hears a guttural growling nearby and spots something moving quickly.]

Deacon: Oh, what the hell? So what the hell am I dealing with here, O'Brian?
        Talk to me.

O'Brian: The guys at the lab nicknamed it the Reacher.
Deacon: The Reacher? What, it's got long arms? Claws? What?
O'Brian: No, it's just — fast. We've clocked it moving forty miles an hour.
Deacon: Forty — Jesus.
O'Brian: And yeah, it's strong. Maybe you should abort —
Deacon: No, no, no, to hell with that. I'm not aborting anything.
O'Brian: This isn't your fight.
Deacon: It is now. St. John out.

[After a lot of hide-and-seek, Deacon guns down the Reacher.]

O'Brian: The Reacher should have a tracking device — take it! Take it! We can
         use it to guide you out.

Deacon: What? How, how O'Brian.¹

O'Brian: We have infrared — we can track the Horde's movements. Take it.

[He walks over to the new corpse to do a biopsy.]

Deacon: Oh Jesus — I hope this was worth it, O'Brian. O'Brian. I got your
        samples.

O'Brian: St. John, get out of there!
Deacon: What?
O'Brian: Get out of there — now! There's a Horde coming —
Deacon: You gotta be kidding me —
O'Brian: Shit, they're gettin' close —
Deacon: Yeah — it's time to finish these guys off —

[Deek leaves after killing the bite-sized horde.]

Deacon: Jesus, O'Brian.
O'Brian: You made it out.
Deacon: Yeah, I made it out, no thanks to you.
O'Brian: Transmitting coordinates. O'Brian out.

[They rendezvous far away from the cave.]

Deacon: O'Brian. Four men died for this shit. Hope it was worth it.

O'Brian: Jesus, listen to you. Those were my men! I don't need you or anyone
         else telling me how —

Deacon: You know, you fly around in your helo, well above the shit. And you
        crawl back into, what? Cozy underground bunker, whatever the fuck. You
        have no idea what it's like out here —

O'Brian: I don't have to listen to this shit —

Deacon: What it takes to survive. Oh, you know those men, Cooper — the others,
        they had no idea what they were walking into, but you did. Didn't you?
        Huh? Didn't you!¹

O'Brian: Radio me when you and your old lady are ready to be lifted out. Maybe
         this time, you'll get on the chopper with her.

[O'Brian leaves in a huff and flies out.]

[After learning Sarah was put under guard in the ark, Garret radios in.]

Garret: Corporal St. John. This is Colonel Garret. Report.
Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

Garret: Corporal. Good. Yes — another traitor was discovered in our midst — a
        spy, working for the Anarchists.

Deacon: Anarchists — again —

Garret: Yes — you remember. He escaped before he could be — apprehended. He was
        chased north, but our patrol lost him. I've marked the position he was
        last seen on your map. We need him alive, Corporal. We need to find out
        what he was doing here — how much he knows — what his group wants.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir. I'll do my best.
Garret: As do we all — as do we all. Dismissed.

[Deek goes to the last-known location.]

Garret: A word of caution — Captain Kouri tells me he was one of our best
        riders — if you let him get away — you won't be able to catch him.

Deacon: Ah, we'll just see about that. St. John out.

[Deacon searches a corpse in a snowy cabin. The rider's flushed just then.]

Deacon: Colonel, I've spotted him. Oh, come on — you're not gonna make this
        easy on me, are ya?

[After a short chase, Deacon unseats the Anarchist and blows up his bike.]

Deacon: Got him! Oh, Goddamn —

[Soon, the villain is hogtied helplessly.]

Deacon: How you doin'¹ buddy, huh? Looks like you're having a — chaotic — day,
        yeah? Just the way you like it?

Marauder: You won't take me alive —

Deacon: Well, I think I already did — don't matter much to me, one way or the
        other. Goddamn Anarchists. Colonel, I've got him. Transmitting the
        coordinates now.

Garret: Good work, Corporal.

[Deek leaves the pleading Anarchist on the snowy highway and leaves. Later...]

Deacon: Colonel, reporting in. Did the, uh — patrol get the prisoner?
Garret: Corporal. I'm afraid not. When we went to retrieve him — he was dead.
Deacon: Wha — dead?
Garret: Poison. He killed himself. We're not sure how.
Deacon: I'm sorry. Sir.
Garret: Don't be. Whatever knowledge he had about us — died with him.
Deacon: Yes¹ sir. St. John out.

[After finishing up missions for Sarah, Garret, Weaver and O'Brian, Deacon
 returns back to Wizard Island. He sees the colonel giving another speech.]

Garret: I have had a — revelation. Last night, a new group of recruits joined
        our ranks and have already been sworn in. They have travelled far,
        from the east, west, south, and north. Their coming to this place, at
        this time, is no accident. They bring word of more camps, like the one
        to the south, which we have purged,¹ camps filled with degenerates,
        thieves, drug addicts, and murderers. We are threatened! All of us!
        Every day we live in the shadow of death. But that shadow is not cast
        by rabid Freaks that surround us. They are part of God's plan. They
        are part of God's punishment. No! No, it is not the Freaks who threaten
        to destroy us. It is our fellow man. Like Noah before us, we have built
        an ark, to save mankind. To save all the knowledge¹ so that when the
        flood waters recede, we may rebuild. But in this age, here at the end
        of the world — God is not sending the oceans from their beds to rise up
        and sweep away the damned. There will be no baptism of water. No. In
        this last age, we are the flood. We are sent forth, to baptize the
        world — with fire! Today, we begin a Holy War against all those who
        have brought down the wrath of God. We will move north! Seek out the
        depraved and cleanse them — from the world. We will move south, find
        the enclaves of the degenerates and destroy them. We will head east —
        uncover the obscene and purge them. We will head west, cast light —

[Deacon walks away from the mad colonel and his bonfire-captivated crowd.]

Deacon: O'Brian. This is St. John, come in.
O'Brian: I'm here.

Deacon: Okay, I hope you're ready, because we're doin' this. We're doin' this
        right now.

O'Brian: Give me your coordinates.
Deacon: Done.
O'Brian: Wait — where are you?
Deacon: Center of Crater Lake — Wizard Island, the Militia camp.
O'Brian: You disabled the RPGs?
Deacon: Ah shit, not yet — I'll get right on that.
O'Brian: Radio me when you're ready. O'Brian out.

Deacon: Gotta get to the RPGs — Where would they be — oh, the towers — it's
        gotta be the towers.

[He goes near a tower and sees soldiers loafing about.]

Deacon: That's right — keep movin' —
Soldier: Hell, man. Did you hear the Colonel's speech?
Officer: But movin' against other camps? Jesus — that's harsh —
Soldier: Find me some grub while you're out.
Officer: Yeah, right.

[When no one's looking, Deacon tampers with the RPG.]

Deacon: Come on, you sonofabitch — That'll do it — Gotta get to Sarah — Sarah —
        Lieutenant Whitaker — come in.

[There's only static.]

Deacon: Dammit — hang on. I'm comin'.

[He visits her lab in the ark. She's conversing with her "bodyguard."]

Sarah: Can't you stand guard — or do whatever it is you're doing — out there?
Soldier: Colonel's orders. Gotta keep eyes on you at all times.
Sarah: Yeah, well, fuck the Colonel's orders.

Soldier: Hey. You watch your mouth. Things are changin' around here. And if you
         don't follow the order —

[Deacon sneaks up on him and KOs him with a sleeper hold.]

Deacon: Make sure we're clear.
Sarah: You're good, you're clear. What's the plan?
Deacon: Okay. I need you to pack your stuff. We're leavin'.
Sarah: How are we gonna get out of here? There are guards everywhere.
Deacon: Hey, do you trust me?

[He flips out his radio.]

Deacon: O'Brian?
O'Brian: I'm here.
Deacon: We're heading up to the cone — we got one shot at this.
O'Brian: Copy that. O'Brian out.
Sarah: Who's O'Brian? Where are we going?

Deacon: Look, I don't have time to explain. You got everything? We're not
        coming back.

Sarah: Yeah, I'm ready,¹ let's go.
Deacon: Alright, stay close, and if we see anyone —
Sarah: Hey —

[She suddenly kisses him.]

Sarah: In case you didn't read my note.

[They start their inner ascent.]

Sarah: Wait, so who's O'Brian? How's he getting us out of here?

Deacon: I told you — O'Brian is how I found you. He was the NERO soldier who
        was there that night — the night that I put you on that chopper —

Sarah: NERO?
Deacon: Oh, shit — Weaver —
Weaver: Look — come on, I need you guys to move these out of the way.

[They sneak into the nursery. Only Weaver knows they're there.]

Weaver: No, no, no. That one. The canister. Right. Private! Are you payin'
        attention? Eyes on your work, man. That canister. Right there.

[When the attendants are distracted, Weaver nods to the pair.]

Deacon: Okay — go, go!
Weaver: Up! I don't want to see that canister fall —

[They sneak past Weaver and his attendants.]

Sarah: Holy shit — he let us go. Weaver let us go. Oh shit — more guards.
Deacon: Okay, hold here.
Sarah: Hey, come on,¹ let's go around them.
Deacon: Okay —
Sarah: So O'Brian — the guy on the NERO chopper — he's coming here?

Deacon: Yeah — look, it's a long story. I'll tell ya all about it once we get
        clear —

Sarah: Wait, so they're still flying? I mean — God, Deacon, they must have
       resources, labs, equipment —

Deacon: Well¹ yeah, I — I'm pretty sure they do. Look — you can ask O'Brian
        when you see him —

Sarah: Another guard. Hold on, I'll distract 'em.
Deacon: Be careful —

[As Deacon hides, Sarah goes up to the sentry.]

Sarah: Soldier — what are you doing?

Officer: I — I'm sorry¹ ma'am — the — this area is off limits —

Sarah: How dare you talk back to an officer.¹ Do you know the penalty for
       disobeying an order? Do you know that we have hanged soldiers for less?
       You do know that, right? I was sent by the Colonel, soldier. He's asked
       me to check on you, specifically you. He mentioned you by name. Do you
       know what that means? Do you?

[Deacon puts him in a sleeper.]

Soldier: Hey — what —
Deacon: Nice.
Sarah: Another guard. I'll see if I can get them to move.
Deacon: Be careful —

[Sarah skips the distraction and sleepers the guard herself.]

Deacon: Well done.
Sarah: Come on — we're almost there. I can't wait to see Boozer again —

Deacon: You, uh — you want to go with me, to Lost Lake — I mean. I mean — I —
        I thought we were going to Cloverdale —

Sarah: No, we are. I mean — I just want to see him. He's like my big brother.
       I don't know, it's not like we have much family left these days — you
       know?

[Another sentry's nearby.]

Sarah: Wait — I'll distract 'em. Soldier — over here, please!
Soldier: Ma'am? This is restricted —

Sarah: Are you questioning me, soldier? Do you see this rank? Huh? Do you know
       that I can have you court-martialed for insubordination, disobeying
       orders, and generally being disrespectful to an officer? Do you know
       who I am? Do you know that I am an officer? That I work directly with
       Colonel Garret? That I have two PhDs in bio-medical science? Are you
       questioning me?

Soldier: Hey — what —

[Deacon puts him to sleep.]

Sarah: Good work.
Deacon: Yeah, you too.
Sarah: I can see daylight. Come on, we're almost out.
Deacon: Yeah, okay, this is it, we're at the cone.

[They finally exit the interior caves.]

Deacon: Okay. We made it.
Sarah: Where is it? Where is he? Where is O'Brian?
Deacon: He'll be here. He'll be here. We just, uh, need to —
Sarah: Oh shit!
Deacon: Oh no —

[Just then, Garret walks out of his tent on tour with some new recruits.]

Garret: Gentlemen¹ this is the top of the cone where you can see we get an
        amazing view here — Oh, Lieutenant! I've just been giving this group
        of new recruits a tour of the island. Oh, we're just about to go down
        into the ark. You should join us.

Sarah: Oh, well, Colonel —

Garret: Gentlemen, this is Lieutenant Whitaker. She heads up part of the
        research team that's exploring ways to use poison to defeat our
        enemies.

[Just then, Skizzo walks out of Garret's tent.]

Skizzo: Traitor!

[Skizzo lunges at Deacon.]

Sarah: What? Wait!
Garret: Wait — wait, no, stay back!

[O'Brian's chopper comes overhead, hovers a moment, and flies off. Deacon and
 Sarah are taken down to Garret's chambers in the ark.]

Sarah: Matt, I was just trying to tell you that were going on a supply run.
Skizzo: Don't listen to her! He's a murderer and a spy.
Sarah: Why would you listen to him over me? You know me Matt.

Skizzo: Do you remember the camp I told you about? Iron Mike, the leader of
        that camp, Lost Lake, sent him here. I'm tellin' you!

Deacon: Oh, this is full of shit. I — I've never even met this motherfucker.
Skizzo: Colonel, you've gotta believe me!
Garret: Enough! Alright. I'm listening.
Skizzo: I am tellin' you. He is a spy.

Sarah: Matt¹ this guy's crazy,¹ you've never seen him before — He comes out of
       nowhere and you're gonna believe him?

Deacon: He's fuckin' lying. What's that camp you're saying I'm from?
        Lost what-the-fuck?

Skizzo: You think I'm lying? You think I'm lying? Is that it? I'm not lying.
        Have him show us your back. Huh? Show us your back.

Garret: Enough! Enough! That's my last warning. Now, we will get to the truth
        of this matter. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
        Captain Kouri, I forget, is that the eighth or² ninth commandment?

Kouri: I don't rightly recall, sir.
Garret: Tell me what you saw and don't lie to me, son. I'll know.
Skizzo: At Lost Lake Camp, he attacked a woman.
Deacon: What the fuck are you talk —
Garret: Corporal!

Skizzo: He wasn't wearin' a shirt. Sonofabitch has a tattoo, covering his back.
        Some satanic shit. It's some kinda dog — dead dog — chewin' through a
        chain or something like it was nothin'. I — I pulled him off her. He
        was drunk, and he fought like hell, but — Who knows what woulda
        happened if I hadn't a' been there? You make him show us his back, and
        you will see who's lyin'.

[Garret motions for soldiers to pick Deacon up.]

Deacon: I'm sorry¹ Colonel, this shit's just so crazy.

[They rip his shirt to reveal his tattooed back.]

Garret: Turn him.

[He sees the tattoo.]

Garret: You wear the image of Cerberus, the Hound of Hades. How fitting, that
        you were discovered ascending from the underworld. But you are not
        Hades, are you? Deacon St. John.

Deacon: He's lyin' to you. I never hurt anyone and the truth is —

Garret: You hide behind angelic names, and clothe yourself in lies. You are
        Judas!

Deacon: Truth is, he got kicked out of camp. Listen to me —

[He punches Deacon hard in the stomach.]

Garret: And what about you, Lieutenant? How convenient that you were with the
        Drifter when the NERO helicopter came by.

Sarah: Colonel, I do not know what you're talking about.

Garret: You were in a NERO camp that was overrun. How long have you been spying
        on us? How long?

Sarah: Matt, I promise, I haven't been —
Garret: More lies!

[He backhands her and points a revolver at her head.]

Garret: I expect this from Drifters. I expect men like him to betray me. But
        an officer?

Kouri: Colonel —

Deacon: It was me! It was me. Colonel, I lied. If you look in my pocket, you're
        gonna find a radio. Because I called them. I called them and I lied. I
        lied to the Lieutenant — I told her that, uh, I needed her to help me
        check a shipment, but — Truth is I just needed a hostage.

O'Brian: Deacon St. John? Drifter¹ are you there? This is NERO, this is
         O'Brian. Drifter?

Garret: I'm sorry, Corporal St. John is unavailable right now.
O'Brian: Wait. Who is this?

[Garret stomps on the radio.]

Garret: Sometimes, in the search for truth, the blood of innocents is spilled.
        I'm sorry, my dear.

[He puts his sidearm away.]

Garret: Release Private — Sarkozi, was it?
Skizzo: Yeah.

Garret: And Kouri, take this Drifter to lockup. Tomorrow, at oh-seven-hundred,
        he will stand trial, and he will hang. Lieutenant. Enough of this. We
        have work to do. Come.

[Garret leaves with Skizzo.]

Garret: Tell me more about this Lost Lake Camp.
Skizzo: Yes¹ sir. Anything you wanna know.
Garret: Lieutenant! Please.
Kouri: Come on. Get up.

[He feebly tries to get free, but Kouri coldcocks him.]

[When he comes to, he's outside of town with Kouri and some other soldiers at
 a campfire. He's not restrained.]

Kouri: Good. I thought I heard you breathin'.
Deacon: Fuck you —
Kouri: That's what I want to hear. Means the shit hasn't broken you yet.
Deacon: Okay. Why?

Kouri: Tat on your back — a dead dog chewing through its chains? Not something
       you see everyday. I did some digging — before we freed you. I was, um —
       I don't know, trying to make sense out of it. This was taken from the
       Lieutenant when she came into the camp.

[He holds up the Mongrel's ring.]

Kouri: My guess is, it's yours.

[He tosses it to Deacon.]

Deacon: Yeah, it's mine.
Kouri: And your wife's name, it ain't Beth.
Deacon: No, it ain't.
Kouri: And you've been out here all this time, trying to find her?
Deacon: Yeah.

Kouri: You just asked me why. Pretty simple, really. The way I figure it, any
       man who goes through God-knows-what to find his "old lady," — does not
       deserve to die at the end of a rope.

Deacon: Wait — wait a — wait a second, you're — you're — you're helping me?
        Well¹ that — that just means you're all gonna hang —

Kouri: We're not goin' back. The Colonel is batshit crazy. Holy war? Genocide?
       I mean, what the fuck is that?

Deacon: Yeah, well then, what's the plan? What are you going to do?

Kouri: We're going east. Yeah. Hopefully we can make it to Reno. You should
       come with us.

Deacon: Nope.
Kouri: Well, you can't go back. The Militia will shoot you on sight —

Deacon: No, I am not leaving without her, uh — and I gotta ride north, I gotta
        warn Iron Mike —

Kouri: It's way too late for that now.
Deacon: Why?
Kouri: They spent all night clearing the Santiam Pass.
Deacon: What?
Kouri: A convoy rode out early this morning, heading north.
Deacon: Oh shit!
Kouri: Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?
Deacon: Yeah, I'm sure.

[They shake hands.]

Kouri: Good luck to you, Deacon St. John.

Deacon: Hey, uh, uh, Kouri. When I told the Colonel about my military service,
        I told him I hated every Goddamn minute of it, but¹ uh — maybe it
        wouldn't have been so bad, if — if I'd served under someone like you.

[He salutes Kouri.]

Kouri: You know, maybe it's not too late.

[Kouri and his followers pull out on their bikes.]

Deacon: Yeah.

[He mounts up himself and rides north.]

Deacon: Gotta get back to Lost Lake — I gotta head north — I gotta save
        Boozer — Rikki and — Iron Mike — I — I — I — I can't save Sarah — I
        can't save Sarah, but I can save them — I'm sorry — Sarah — I'm sorry.
        But I am not — giving up. I'm gonna find a way. I'm gonna come back for
        you, I swear to God, I am coming back for you. I gotta head north —
        take the, uh — Santiam Highway. It's clear now. Yeah, that's the
        fastest way.

[Deek turns onto a snowy highway.]

Deacon: Santiam — this way. Head north. A checkpoint — shit — this wasn't here
        before. No way around it —

Soldier: It's St. John — shoot that sonofabitch!
Soldier: It's the traitor! Kill him!

[Soon, the enemies are dead and the way can be cleared.]

Deacon: Is that all of 'em? Huh? Where'd you all go? Yeah — yeah, that's what
        I thought. Hang on, Boozer — I'm comin'.

[Another sniper-infected checkpoint is placed at the tunnel's mouth.]

Soldier: Hey, hey, hey — hey, it's St. John! We — we got orders to shoot on
         sight!

[He slays everyone and finds the tunnel completely blocked by a gate.]

Deacon: Alright, fine. Gotta blow my way in —

[He does.]

Deacon: Tunnel's clear — Militia cleared it — thank you, Skizzo —

[At the other end...]

Deacon: Oh dammit — they've taken over the old NERO checkpoint — not getting
        through here without a fight. Come on — let's do this. Goddamn Militia
        — come on!

[He slays the heavies and clears the way into Lost Lake territory.]

Deacon: Boozer — you there? Come back — Boozeman, come back.

[Boozer radios in, but signs of battling can also be heard.]

Boozer: Deek — is that you? Yeah — move 'em in here, Goddammit. Addy, get the
        wounded inside.

Deacon: Boozer?!

Boozer: Deek — glad to hear you breathin', brother — we sure could use you
        about now — get 'em inside! Move, dammit, move. Shit — look out!

Deacon: I'm coming¹ Boozer — I'm almost there, uh — Skizzo — Skizzo, he's
        there, Boozer — he's coming for you —

Boozer: They're — they're comin' in through the gate — go, go! Let him come —
        Deek — let him come —

Deacon: Boozer! — dammit — Rikki — Lost Lake Camp¹ come in! — Rikki? Iron Mike?
        Come in!

Rikki: Shit — Deek! You're alive — Skizzo said you were dead — find Skizzo,
       dammit — find Iron Mike —

Deacon: Rikki, talk to me — what's going on¹ — what —

Rikki: Skizzo came rolling in with an army — Militia — find him — now! The
       lodge — get up to the lodge! Move, dammit — he said — he was bringing
       supplies, wanted to make amends, begged Iron Mike to forgive him —

Deacon: Rikki, you — no — you didn't, oh God — Iron Mike didn't —

Rikki: Then — all hell broke loose — they started shooting — I — I can't find
       him, Deek — Iron Mike — I can't find him —

Deacon: Rikki?! Rikki! Oh Goddammit.

[He beelines for Iron Mike's camp. In the aftermath, near the lodge...]

Deacon: Hey — hey!
Survivor: They're pulling out! They're on the run!
Survivor: We got 'em! We got 'em!
Deacon: Where's Skizzo? Has anyone seen Skizzo?
Survivor: Right on, dude —
Deacon: Where the hell is Skizzo?

Survivor: Bunch of us have been lookin' for him. No one's seen him. Hey¹ don't
          worry. We're gonna find that asshole.

Rikki: Deek! Thank God, come on.
Deacon: Rikki, what's goin' on?
Rikki: It's Iron Mike, he got shot.

[She takes him to the lodge where Addy is treating Iron Mike in his bed. It's
 clear he's mortally wounded.]

Deacon: Hey¹ you lazy sonofabitch, I wanted to — See if you wanted to go
        fishing. We got a camp to feed.

Iron Mike: You — you find her? Found her? Your ol' lady?
Deacon: Yeah, Mike. She's right outside.
Iron Mike: She — she's here?

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah, look — I, uh — I couldn't have done this without your help
        —

Iron Mike: Okay — good — that's good — that's good — I wanna meet her — gotta
           be a — hell of a gal to — go through all that trouble — Kinda like
           my Elizabeth —

[He starts spitting up blood.]

Rikki: Okay, okay, okay. Here¹ Mike. Here.
Addy: Mike, I want you to take this.
Iron Mike: No, no. I don't want it. I don't want it. I can —
Rikki: Here, Mike — be careful.
Iron Mike: I was — I was — I was wrong — Deek —

Deacon: No — no, no. We can keep this together, Mike, we just — You get back
        on your feet, you'll see we're gonna make —

Iron Mike: I was — I was wrong. I was — I was wrong. You do what you have to —
           to, to — you, you — you keep this camp safe. Rikki?

Rikki: Yeah, I'm here¹ Mike. I'm here.

[Before he can say anything else, he dies.]

Rikki: Mike? Mike?

[Deacon and Rikki walk outside after awhile.]

Deacon: There's no easy way to say this. Iron Mike's dead. He, uh, he stopped
        — He tried to stop Skizzo when the Militia were pullin' out. Iron Mike,
        bein' Iron Mike, he tried to reason with him, and —

[The crowd is rambling to themselves.]

Deacon: Okay. Yeah — I — Shut up! Shut — up! This ain't no eulogy. Iron Mike
        wouldn't want that. We — we don't have time for this, because —
        Because the men who we killed today — Well, there's more where that
        came from. A lot more. I've been to their camp. I've seen their army.
        And when they come back here, they're gonna slaughter each and every
        one of you. At least they're gonna try. Unless we hit them first.

[The crowd continues to argue amonst themselves.]

Rikki: Hey! Hey¹ shut up! Shut — up! Listen to him. Iron Mike trusted him, so
       you have to trust him!

Deacon: No, no, no. I'm sorry. You know what? I can't do this. I'm not Iron
        Mike. I'm a Goddamn Drifter.

Rikki: You're right. There's the road.

Deacon: No, I'm not — fucking leaving. Look at me. Listen — Alright, find
        Boozer, tell him to meet me at my cabin.

[Later, at Boozer's cabin...]

Deacon: Okay, so I found this in a survivalist bunker.
Rikki: Wait, this is —

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna need a truck, something big, something like a
        dump truck — And we're gonna fill it full of, uh — 

Boozer: Ammonium nitrate?

Deacon: — fertilizer — yep. We're gonna mix it with a hundred gallons of
        creosote.

Boozer: A fertilizer truck bomb. That's your plan.
Rikki: Oh my God.

Deacon: The Militia have turned this entire island into a fortress. I got
        civilians in the caves. You got the labor force, and those considered
        "unfit to serve" in this survivor camp. And you've got the armory —
        and the garrison right by the main gate. If we hit that, then we tear
        out the heart of the Colonel's Militia.

Boozer: What about Sarah?

Deacon: Well, I — she's — in the caves, it's what the Colonel calls the ark.

Rikki: How — how do you know that they're not just gonna kill everybody? Sarah
       — Sarah and everyone else?

Deacon: I — I don't — I don't. But I figure that the explosion will cause so
        much confusion and chaos, that they're — I can go in, I can find her,
        I can get her out before they know what hit 'er. Look, this isn't about
        just Sarah anymore. The Colonel has declared war on all of us and he's
        got an army to back him up. Look, Iron Mike and the rest of them —
        they're just the first casualties in that war — And it's gonna be a
        short one unless we hit them first.

[Rikki and Boozer barely react.]

Deacon: I didn't say it was a good plan.
Rikki: No, it's a really shitty one, Deek.
Deacon: You with me¹ brother?
Boozer: Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
Rikki: Okay. Well, we're not going to be able to do it alone.

Deacon: Alright, okay, well. If anyone wants to join in, you hit 'em — you hit
        'em at the South Gate. Because when the explosion happens¹ all the
        Militia, they're gonna rush up toward the main gate.

Rikki: Alright, we're gonna need some supplies. Crazy asses.

[Later, if Deek rides around outside town...]

Rikki: Deek, you there?
Deacon: Yeah, yeah¹ Rikki. I'm here.
Rikki: I just wanted to say — thank you. For coming back to help us.
Deacon: I'm just sorry I was too late —
Rikki: You weren't — we'll stop him. Skizzo. We're gonna stop him, right?
Deacon: Yeah. We're gonna stop him.

Rikki: I wanted to say I'm sorry — about your — about Sarah. I can't imagine
       what you must be going through — losing someone — twice — like that.

Deacon: Hey — I haven't lost her yet — we're building a really big bomb —
        remember?

Rikki: Well — we're glad to have you back. Lost Lake needs you.

Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki, uh — it wasn't his fault, you know. Iron Mike, I mean —
        he was — he was only trying to — do the right thing.

Rikki: I know. Rikki out.

[After some rest, Deek meets Rikki near the town square. She and Boozer are
 already working on a fortified dump truck for their rolling bomb.]

Boozer: How's it comin'?
Rikki: Back up.
Boozer: Hey, Deek.
Deacon: Hey. Uh — what's this?

[He points to a platform welded above the truck's cabin.]

Rikki: Oh, ask him.
Boozer: Well — Truck's as big as a tank, right?
Deacon: Uh-huh —
Boozer: I figured — Might as well turn her into one.

[He motions to some thick metal plating laying nearby.]

Deacon: Holy shit. Uh — is this — ready?
Rikki: Well, let's see, Deek.

[She climbs in.]

Rikki: Kay¹.

[The truck fires up.]

Rikki: Oh yeah! She's ready!
Boozer: Time to fill 'er up.
Deacon: I know where to find some fertilizer. I'll radio when I'm ready.
Rikki: Okay!

[Deek rides out for ex-Ripper territory.]

Boozer: So, what's your plan?

Deacon: I'm thinking we can find all the fertilizer we need over at the Iron
        Butte Ranch.

Boozer: Iron Butte Ranch?

Deacon: Yeah — I mean¹ it's not like — Jessie and his Rippers are gonna need
        it anymore. I mean, this place used to be a golf resort, yeah? They've
        gotta have² maintenance area, you know, lawn mowers, and, uh —

Boozer: Fertilizer. Goddamn right.

Deacon: Yeah, I'm gonna head over there right now. When it's clear, I'm gonna
        radio you and Rikki to bring the truck in.

Boozer: You got it, brother. Alright, Boozer out.

[Soon after, a surprising voice reaches out.]

Skizzo: Deek — ya there?

Deacon: Skizzo — oh¹ you got some nerve calling me —

Skizzo: Bro, there you are. You gotta listen — look, I tried to stop 'em, I
        did. From shootin' Iron Mike. I did not want it to go down like that,
        bro.

Soldier: Captain, the Colonel wants to see you right away —

Skizzo: Yeah, yeah, look — I'll tell him I'll be right there —

Deacon: Captain — didn't take you long to lie your way into a promotion.

Skizzo: This army crap is all bullshit and you know it — but¹ bro, you gotta
        listen to me —

Deacon: I'm not your "bro," Skizzo —

Skizzo: Fair enough. I just wanted you to know — look, when Kouri busted you
        out, the Colonel — he went crazy. Thought she was in on it. He lost his
        Goddamn mind. He went after Lieutenant Whitaker — he was gonna kill
        her, Deek. Deek?

Deacon: Yeah — I'm listening.

Skizzo: But I stopped him, Deek. I did. I told him that all that poison shit
        she's cookin' up, maybe we use it to kill the Freaks, but maybe we
        don't. Maybe there's an enemy camp — maybe they got one water supply —
        maybe dumpin' a gallon of hemlock into that, maybe that solves a lotta
        problems — Anyway — the Colonel — he likes that idea. So he puts me in
        charge of the ark — wants me to keep it safe — she reports to me now,
        Deek. To me.

Deacon: What do you want, Skizzo?

Skizzo: Bro, I just wanted to warn you — they're comin' — I can't stop 'em —
        they're comin' — and this time — this time the Colonel's bringin' the
        whole damn house —

Deacon: Well, let him — we're not going anywhere. And when he comes, this time,
        we'll be ready for him.

Skizzo: Hey, Deek —

Soldier: Captain, the Colonel's waiting.

Skizzo: I'll be there, Goddammit, now get out. Hey, Deek. Look — I gotta go —
        but, uh — I'll tell Lieutenant Whitaker — that you send your best
        wishes. Captain Sarkozi signing off.

Deacon: Goddamn you¹ Skizzo.

[Deek rides to the ranch.]

Deacon: Oh shit — no — that's a Horde, that's a Horde! I'm gonna have to clear
        this before Rikki can get in or she's gonna pull 'em all down on us.
        Hey¹ Boozer, uh — tell Rikki it's, uh — it's gonna be awhile — cause¹
        there's a — Horde feeding ground right in our way —

Boozer: A Horde — you want me and Rikki to head out there? Come and help?

Deacon: Nope, no, no — I've already learned the hard way, it's better to take
        'em on alone — that way we don't pull 'em down on each other.

Boozer: Yeah — yeah, okay.

Deacon: Besides — I mean¹ Rikki says that, uh — yeah, you're head of security
        now, right? So — don't ya gotta — I don't know — like stick around
        camp? Polish your badge? Order people around? Shit like that?

Boozer: Yeah right — I forgot to ask Mike for a badge — I — well, anyway. Now
        that Mike's gone — I don't know, maybe they'll vote someone else in —
        let me go back to pullin' weeds.

Deacon: Dude, not likely.

Boozer: Hey, wouldn't be no skin offa my nose — but let me know when you're
        ready — Rikki wants to get this show on the road! Boozer out.

[Deek starts cutting a path through the large horde.]

Deacon: Almost — done —

[Finally, every Freaker lies still.]

Deacon: And that — my friend — is all of 'em — Jesus — Boozeman, you there?
        It's clear, you can¹ uh — have Rikki bring the truck over.

Boozer: Copy that — hey¹ Deek, we got a surprise for ya, brother —
Deacon: Great — that's great, can't wait. Deacon out.

[Eventually, Boozer drives the dump truck to the abandoned ranch compound.]

Deacon: Hey!
Boozer: Hey.
Deacon: I need — what the hell is that?
Boozer: Little gift from Rikki.

[His arm has a melon-baller add-on instead of a knife.]

Boozer: Still can't ride a bike, but I can shift the hell outta these gears.
Deacon: Wow. Uh — Pull it over there.
Boozer: Alright.

[The loading commences for awhile.]

Deacon: Okay! Oh God. That oughta be enough.
Boozer: Alright, what's next?
Deacon: Creosote. I'll radio you when I'm ready.
Boozer: Where the hell are we gonna get a hundred gallons of creosote?
Deacon: You don't wanna know.

_______________________________________________________________________________

[Soon after the fertilizer is acquired...]

Rikki: Deek — I need to talk to you.
Deacon: Rikki, what's wrong?
Rikki: Militia —
Deacon: What? Where?

Rikki: Boozer thinks they might be planning another attack, so he asked me to
       send you to take a look.

Deacon: Goddamn Militia — yeah, I got this.
Rikki: Thank God. I'll let Boozer know. Rikki out.

[Deek rides out to the Militia camp in Lost Lake's southern territory.]

Deacon: Goddamn Militia — Oh God, I'm gonna kill every one of you bastards —
        An entire squad? Ahh, gotta be careful. Goddamn Militia — come on —
        Come on, you sonsofbitches —

[Finally, all eight are slain. If Deek kills the marauders up the road, too:]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Many of you
          probably don't remember the Cold War, but living through it was a
          special kind of hell. Every time you heard a plane flyin' overhead,
          you'd think for sure that this is it, that's the one coming to drop
          the big one on us. And we lived through the Red Scare. A man didn't
          know if his neighbor was an American who bled red, white, and blue,
          or a Communist, red to the bone. Made it hard to trust. My father —
          God rest him — taught me the only way to be safe in dark times was
          to go underground. Built my first bunker with him. But we couldn't
          build it out in the backyard, with the neighbors spyin'. Had to go
          out into the woods, a ways from the road, where no one would happen
          upon it. With a bunker, you knew that if the country went to hell in
          a handbasket, you could open that manhole cover, climb down the
          ladder, and you'd be safe — with your radio, and your hoard of food
          and ammo. Things haven't changed. Better to dig a bunker, than an
          early grave. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't
          believe the lies.

Deacon: Yeah, Cope? How'd that work out for the poor bastards who owned the one
        that I just cleared out? Huh? Not so good, I'm guessing, since they
        were all dead long before I ever got there.

Copeland: Come on. Get 'em inside.
Deacon: What happened?

Copeland: Got hit again. Squatters, off the highway. We gotta get some men
          together, go after 'em.

Deacon: Don't look at me, it ain't my problem.
Copeland: They've got Manny.
Deacon: You sent Manny on a supply run.

Copeland: I just run the camp, Deek. I don't tell folks howta live their lives

[Deek rides out to the Squatter camp to save Manny. He sees a bike nearby.]

Deacon: Cope, I found his bike. I'm gonna see if I can track him down.

Copeland: My men said they'd set up an ambush on the Santiam.
Deacon: Yeah, I already found it. Deacon out.

[Deacon goes through some obstacles to find a Freaker-overrun campground.]

Deacon: Ugh —

[Eventually, he locates the camp and kills a dozen enemies.]

Manny: Deek!
Deacon: Hi¹ Manny.
Manny: Hey, hey!

Deacon: I wasn't gonna let 'em kill ya. Besides, who the hell else around here
        knows how to rebuild a carburetor?

[Just then, a rager wanders into sight.]

Deacon: Okay. Just back up, nice and slow. Don't make a sound —

[Manny knocks over a tin can. Loudly. Deacon goes to work whittling it down.]

Manny: Ha! You got it! You got it! Deek, ya almost got it!

[Finally, the sucker dies.]

Manny: Jesus, Deek — you did it.
Deacon: Oh Jesus — it's clear —
Manny: I've been campin' too long — never saw nothin' like that before.
Deacon: Yeah, okay. Let's, uh — get the hell outta here —
Manny: Hey, you don't gotta twist my arm on that one.
Deacon: So what the hell happened? What were you doin' out here?

Manny: I don't know. Hadn't been on a run in months — it felt like maybe I
       wasn't — I don't know, doin' my share. You know?

Deacon: Lotta assholes with guns out here, Manny — not many who know how to
        fix the shit that they ride around on.

Manny: Yeah, yeah. That's what Cope said.
Deacon: Yeah, for once I agree with the sonofabitch.
Manny: So whaddya think, why's it gotta be this way?
Deacon: Be what way?
Manny: Everyone out here tryin' to kill everyone else.

Deacon: Manny — you know how many folks were locked up in prisons before this
        shit went down? I mean, here in the states —

Manny: Uh — no idea.

Deacon: Two and a half million. You count the ones that are out on parole and
        probation — that's almost seven million. So — one in thirty-five — was
        someone who didn't give a shit about the law. And those are just the
        ones that got caught.

Manny: Shit.

Deacon: So the question isn't — why is it like this now,¹ the question is why
        wasn't it always like this.¹

Manny: Guess I'll be stickin' to the camp from now on.
Deacon: That's probably a good idea. You good from here?

Manny: Yeah, yeah. Hey¹ Deek? I owe you, man. I'd be dead right now if it you
       hadn't —

Deacon: Manny — nose down.
Manny: Nose down. They feed ya.
Deacon: Now get the hell outta here.

[Manny rides off on his bike.]

Deacon: Cope, I found him.

Copeland: Thank God and country. He's alive?

Deacon: He's a little banged up, but he'll live. I'm guessin' a few Drifters
        were trying to find out about your camp — how many men you have, how
        many guns.

Copeland: I hope he told 'em — we have all the damn guns we need. And we mean
          to keep 'em. Feds don't got no more to say about that, now do they?

Deacon: No, I guess they don't. Manny gets back, tell him to keep his nose
        down. St. John out.

Boozer: Alright¹ brother, you're killin' me. Where you getting the creosote?
Deacon: You just like driving that dump truck around.
Boozer: You're Goddamn right I do.

Deacon: Alright, um — I'm headin' to the Old Sawmill. They got a couple of
        storage tanks there that should have all the creosote we need.

Boozer: The Old Sawmill? Last I checked, there was a Horde there. Big Goddamn
        Horde.

Deacon: Yeah. I'm, uh — pretty sure I knew that.
Boozer: What, you still got a death wish? I mean, even after finding your old
        lady? Deek — we're gonna get her back —

Deacon: Boozeman — no, no — I don't — look, I can handle this. Just be ready.
        I'll radio when it's clear to bring your rig in. Deacon out.

[Soon after...]

Rikki: Deek?
Deacon: Yeah¹ Rikki.
Rikki: Boozer just told me you're heading for the Old Sawmill.
Deacon: Uh, yeah — and Boozer has a big mouth.

Rikki: He is head of security — he has to tell me. You remember when I took
       you to the sawmill, right? You remember me showing you the Horde that —
       lives there?

Deacon: Oh yeah — I remember.
Rikki: The really big Horde that lives, sleeps, and eats there?

Deacon: Uh, yeah, like I said — I remember. Uh¹ look, Rikki — when I was with
        the Militia — they, uh — we — we created a sorta souped¹ up Molotov —

Rikki: A souped¹ up Molotov —
Deacon: Yeah, yeah — it's — it's like napalm. Anyway, trust me — I got this —
Rikki: We need you, Deek — alive —

Deacon: Rikki — just — I'll be fine. You don't gotta worry about me no more —
        okay? I know what I'm doing. Rikki?

Rikki: Yeah¹ Deek —
Deacon: I'm, uh — just lightin' some candles.
Rikki: Okay.

Deacon: Yeah — and in — in this case, some big Goddamn Molotovs — but, you
        know, you get the idea —

Rikki: Yeah, okay.
Deacon: Deacon out.

[He arrives at the destination.]

Deacon: The Old Sawmill. This oughta be — easy, right? Just gotta make sure I
        have enough, uh — traps, ammo, Molotovs, and anything else I can
        carry —

[He riles the crowd.]

Deacon: Oh my God this is a lot of Freaks — Too many — too many! Crawl under
        here — go, go — Ah shit — more of 'em! C'mon — is that all you got?
        Is that all of 'em — oh yeah — oh Jesus —

[At long last, the Horde expires. Boozer arrives afterwards.]

Boozer: Holy shit, Deek. Looks like I missed all the fun.
Deacon: Yeah. Next time — I drive the truck. You fight the Freakers.
Boozer: Yeah, brother.
Deacon: Okay, just pull it over there.
Boozer: Alright, you got it.

[Soon, the creosote is loaded.]

Deacon: Alright, that's it. Head back to camp. I'll meet you there.
Boozer: Alright.
Deacon: And — uh — Boozeman. Drive carefully.
Boozer: Whaddya think? That I'm gonna blow myself up?

Deacon: Looks like everything's set.

Boozer: Yeah. Rikki rigged this up for the steering wheel. We drive right up
        to the front door, jump — goodbye¹ Militia.

Deacon: Okay, well, you sure you wanna do this? I mean, it's a long way to

Boozer: Asshole.
Deacon: Look, Boozer, you and I both know this is probably a one-way trip.

Boozer: Yeah. Then I won't have to drive back. Fuck yeah, I want this. Oh, but

Alkai: Tucker sends word that¹ uh — she couldn't make it to the fight, but
       wishes she could be here.

Deacon: Yeah, I'll bet.

Alkai: That we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your help. We're here to
       return the favor.

Deacon: Alright — okay. Well, you guys ready to kick some Militia ass?

[The Salome folks cheer.]

Alkai: We're ready to ride.

[Deek shakes his hand and goes in front of all the groups.]

Deacon: Alright, listen up! The plan is simple. Boozer and I are gonna hit the
        North Gate, we're gonna blow it to hell, and that's gonna pull everyone
        at the South Gate. And what you gotta do, is just follow Rikki. Yeah?
        Are we ready? How about you two, are we ready? Listen, I'm gonna radio
        when we hit the bridge. Don't go in until then.

Rikki: Okay.

Deacon: Alright! Let's do this!

[He climbs onto Boozer's armored dump truck.]

Deacon: For Iron Mike.

[Everyone gets into positions during the night. Boozer and Deacon race toward
 the North Gate.]

Deacon: Hey, Boozer, we gotta jump! Hey, Boozeman, time to go!

Boozer: We got one shot at this¹ brother!

Deacon: Dammit, Boozer.

 water alongside the North Gate's bridge.]

Deacon: Boozer!

[The North Gate blows up, sending the palisade flying like matchsticks.]

Deacon: No. No.

Deacon: Boozer — why didn't you jump — You shoulda — you shoulda jumped —
        Boozer — Oh Goddammit¹ Boozer — oh Goddammit —

Deacon: I am going to kill — every Goddamn one of you! Sarah, Sarah — I gotta
        get to Sarah — A heavy — oh Goddammit — Oh¹ you're not gonna stop me —
        Hang on — Sarah! — I'm almost there — Ark — I gotta get to the ark —

[Just then, the ark's lower entrance explodes. He can hear Skizzo nearby.]

Skizzo: It's sealed! Come on, get to the upper cave. Move it! Go! Get up there
        and start setting charges. I said go, Goddammit! Go!

[When Deacon gets up, Skizzo's already gone.]

Deacon: Skizzo — sonofabitch Skizzo — I'm coming, Skizzo — Oh, well now we

        the cone — I gotta find a way past these guys — Flamethrower — shit,

Deacon: Rikki? Rikki? Ah, give 'em hell¹ Rikki — burn 'em to the ground.

[Deek finally makes it to the summit.]

Deacon: Made it — finally — Hang on¹ Sarah — Sniper — get down —

[Deek hears soldiers planting charges in the cone's inner ramp system.]

Officer: Hurry it up already.
Soldier: Fuck you. You want me to blow us both to hell?
Officer: Goddammit, you hear that? Hurry up.
Soldier: There. It's good to go.
Officer: Alright. How many is that?
Soldier: Enough.

Officer: Captain Sarkozi, reporting in — we —

Officer: Captain, we didn't have time to set them all —
Skizzo: What? Goddammit — how many?

Skizzo: Okay, okay. I'm going down to get the detonator from Weaver — you hold
        the cave entrance — you got that? No one gets down here.

Officer: Yes¹ sir, understood¹ sir. No one gets down.
Skizzo: And stay off this Goddamn channel — it might have been compromised —

Deacon: Here's one — I gotta disarm it — There — Okay, Goddammit — where's the

Skizzo: No — no! Damn you — die¹ Goddammit!

Skizzo: No —

Deacon: And I woulda left you to the Freaks. But — hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

        course.

[As Garret drinks his tea, Sarah pours and shakes her head at Deacon.]

Garret: When the world was cleansed, it was the only thing that would allow us
        to rebuild. Everything was here, protected, saved by the grace of God.
        We never did find someone to play the piano though, did we? Ah, it
        doesn't matter now. When all this is gone, there'll be nobody left to
        hear the music. You've destroyed us. You destroyed everything we worked
        for.

Deacon: No¹ Colonel. You did. When you started this holy war. You know — given
        the choice between you and the Freaks — I'm gonna have to go with them.
        Because at least when they kill, they're just lookin' for a meal. And
        they don't kill unarmed women.

[He points a revolver at Deacon.]

Sarah: No!

[She struggles with the gun and gets whacked in the face for her effort. Deek
 struggles as well, but halfway through, the Colonel simply drops dead. He
 spills his teacup, revealing the hemlock inside the "herbal" brew.]

Sarah: You came back. Come on. Okay. Let's go.

[Outside, some of the fires rage, but the battle has ended. People are being
 treated and some are captured.]

Sarah: Oh my God. Hey, where's Boozer?
Deacon: He's gone.
Sarah: Oh shit. Why don't you go get some water, okay?
Deacon: Okay, okay.
Sarah: Hey, uh, could you set up a triage tent over there?

[Sarah walks off with a survivor; Deacon does the same with someone else.]

Deacon: Hey. Hey. There's a cave entrance over there. You'll find supplies and
        bandages. Get some men, go. Rikki! Addy!

Addy: I can help. I'm a doctor.

[Addy, responding to some cries for help, walks off.]

Rikki: It's over. Everyone that wasn't killed or wounded by the blast pretty
       much just gave up. Where's Boozer?

Addy: Rikki, I need some help over here! Rikki!
Rikki: Yeah. Um — What do you need help with?

[Rikki wanders off to Addy. Suddenly, from behind Deacon...]

Boozer: Hey. Hope you saved some for me.
Deacon: Boozer.
Boozer: Sorry I'm late.
Deacon: No —
Boozer: Yeah.
Deacon: No, no, no —
Boozer: I jumped.
Deacon: No — what the fuck — you were —
Boozer: Just before I ran outta bridge — yeah —
Deacon: I saw the truck —

Boozer: No, no, no, I felt the blast wave — Even under ten feet a' water. Now
        that was a ride!

Deacon: You did —

[They hug it out.]

Deacon: What —

Boozer: What? You didn't think I'd blow myself up¹ did ya? Then who'd be around
        to bust your balls?

Sarah: I would.
Boozer: Hey, hey. Oh — Little sister.
Sarah: Hey.

[She looks at his arm.]

Sarah: Oh —
Boozer: Yeah, yeah, long story. So, um — I hear someone's been lookin' for ya.
Deacon: Wha —
Boozer: Kinda wouldn't shut up about it.
Deacon: Yeah, don't listen to him. It was really — More his idea than it —
Boozer: Rikki! Addy! Which one a' you's drivin' me outta this shithole?

[Around dusk, everyone gathers at the top of the cone. Weaver hands him a flag
 removed from the flagpole.]

Weaver: It's all yours, brother.
Deacon: So, I hear that you're staying on to rebuild.
Weaver: Not all the Colonel's ideas were bad. Just the batshit crazy ones.
Deacon: You're the second person to tell me that.
Weaver: Who else? Kouri? You know what? Fuck that dude.
Deacon: Hey —
Weaver: He left us here to rot.
Deacon: If it wasn't for him we'd all be dead.

Weaver: Whatever, man. And I think we'll try this again without all the army
        man bullshit.

[Weaver starts leaving with his headphones in.]

Deacon: Hey. You're gonna miss my speech.
Weaver: Nah, I wouldn't say I'm gonna "miss" it.

[He walks over to some of the other community bigshots.]

Copeland: Deek. Helluva fight.
Deacon: Yeah, that it was. Manny. Ho, shit, look who's still breathin'.
Manny: Nose down.
Deacon: Nose down.
Manny: Keep it on your face that way.
Alkai: Not bad for a Drifter.

[Deek goes over to Boozer after.]

Deacon: Brother —
Boozer: We did it. You did it.

Deacon: Ah¹ man. You know I got to, uh — Admit for a second there I thought
        that you were, um —

Boozer: Gonna blow myself up? I told you, I got shit to do.
Deacon: Uh, well —
Boozer: Give 'em hell, brother.
Deacon: Yeah, here goes.
Boozer: Jack would be proud.

[Addy and Rikki are nearby.]

Addy: You did it.
Deacon: We did it. Come here.
Rikki: See? Good things happen when you stop and light a candle.
Deacon: Well¹ this is sort of more of a bonfire, but — yeah.
Rikki: Right —

[Deek walks over to his wife.]

Sarah: I've never seen you give a speech before.
Deacon: Oh, c'mon, it ain't gonna be a speech.
Sarah: Okay.
Deacon: Ma'am.

[She notices she's still wearing a Militia armband. She tosses it in the fire.]

Sarah: Shit. That's enough of that.
Deacon: Ah, what does it mean, that they're all getting quiet?
Sarah: Oh yeah. They're waiting for you. That's your cue.
Deacon: Goddammit. Sonofa —

[He addresses the crowd.]

Deacon: I know we got a lot of rebuilding to do, so I'm gonna keep this short.
        Look, I'm not a leader. I don't care what you say. I'm not. But, um.
        You've done something here today — we've done something. We banded
        together to fight. Not because some asshole told us to — But because
        it was the right thing to do. And you know what? We won! You know, I've
        seen you struggle. To rebuild. I've seen you fight to save lives. To
        keep people safe, keep people fed. I've seen you sacrifice everything
        that you have, everything that you are — To make the world a better
        place. And see — That's why we're still here. That's why we're still
        here. Because if we don't have hope, for a better life, or for a future
        that matters? The hell are we fighting for? You know, Iron Mike¹ he,
        um — He once said to me that — that we make the world what it is by
        what we do. Huh? What did we do? Huh? What are we going to do? You
        see this?

[He unfurls the Militia flag in his hands.]

Deacon: This is the first step.

[He tosses it on the fire.]

Sarah: I thought you weren't gonna give a speech.
Deacon: Yeah, I screwed up. Uh — how the hell was it?
Sarah: Oh, you know, it was — it was alright. For an outlaw biker.
Deacon: Outlaw biker, huh? Well, you ready to ride, old lady?
Sarah: I don't know, depends. Where are we going?
Deacon: Wherever the hell we want.

[They kiss in front of the bonfire. Roll credits as everyone travels back from
 Wizard Island to their respective communities.]

[Later, Deek meets Rikki and Addy at the Lost Lake cemetery.]

Deacon: Hey.
Addy: Hey¹ Deacon.

[He looks at Iron Mike's grave marker.]

Rikki: Addy carved it herself. It's beautiful, right?

Addy: Thanks. Yeah, it was a piece of redwood Mike kept in his room. He once
      told me that when things settled down, he was going to make something
      out of it, like a — cribbage board.

Deacon: Wait, a what? A — he doesn't — play cribbage. Iron Mike played
        cribbage?

Addy: No. No, but that's the point. That there'd come a day when something like
      that mattered again.

Deacon: Well, what does it say?
Addy: Don't look at me,¹ I just carved it.

Rikki: It's, uh — it's an old Hindu proverb. My mother taught it to me. It
       reads — "Rivers do not drink their own water. Trees do not eat their
       own fruit. And clouds do not swallow their own rain. What great ones
       have is always for the benefit of others." What do you think?

Addy: Well, coming from you, I think that would have meant a lot to him.

Deacon: Yeah. Yeah, I think if Mike were here he would probably say something
        like —  "What — the hell does that even mean?" Huh? C'mon.

[They have a good laugh.]

Rikki: Yeah — no, you're right. He woulda said, "What the hell does that mean?"

Deacon: Followed by "What the hell are you doin' standin' around here? The
        world ain't gonna save itself Goddammit. Get to work."

Rikki: Yep. You're right again. C'mon¹ guys, let's get to work.

[They start walking away.]

Rikki: Oh, did I ever tell you about the time Iron Mike — Saw Addy and I for
       the first time at the lodge in front of the fireplace¹ —

Addy: Oh, this is funny.
Rikki: Okay, so we were tangled up —
Addy: No, no, no, no — we were all up in it —
Rikki: Okay, Addy — Addy —
Deacon: What — uh — uh — why
Rikki: For the first time, and Iron Mike comes out. And he looks at us —
Deacon: You don't have to tell me this. You can stop.
Rikki: He had that grin on his face.
Deacon: I'm not grin —
Rikki: You're such a perv, Deek!
Deacon: Oh my God. I'm tired a' you two.
Addy: You are a perv.

[At some point, Deacon walks near the Lost Lake main gate and finds Lisa being
 held at gunpoint.]

Guard: Hey! We got a Goddamn Ripper here! Turn around!
Lisa: I'm not a Ripper!

Deacon: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up, hold up. I know her. Uh — put
        that away, I got this.

Guard: Okay. Take care of her. Not my problem.

[He leaves Deacon and Lisa in awkward silence.]

Deacon: Is — is this your ride?
Lisa: It's a piece of shit — but it runs.

Deacon: Uh, well, I don't know if you're stickin' around but I could have Rikki
        take a look at it.

Lisa: I brought some bounties. To trade.

[He looks in her bloody bag of severed ears.]

Deacon: Okay. Then, uh, I should probably introduce you to — Joe Haslin, he's
        the bounty collector. He's right up this way.

Lisa: I'm not staying. I'm not staying in a Goddamn camp.

Deacon: Yeah, do whatever you want. You know, while you're here, uh, I'd like
        to introduce you, uh — To someone. Her name is Sarah. She had a kid
        sister that¹ um — Well, her kid sister reminds me of you. So I thought
        that maybe you — would like her.

Lisa: I had a sister. She was older than me. A pain in my ass.

Deacon: Kinda reminds me of my older brother, Boozer, a real pain in the ass —
        Actually he — he's not my brother, um — We rode together in the M.C.
        And he's the head of security around here, so you should probably meet
        him too.

Lisa: I told you I'm not staying.

Deacon: And I heard you. Seriously, do whatever you want. So what kinda gun
        you got there? Are you making sure that you ride out with plenty of
        ammo?

Lisa: Yeah, I got enough, I'm good.
Deacon: Oh, I always rather had to work at that.

[While exploring the world, Deacon suddenly gets a call.

O'Brian: St. John. Are you there?
Deacon: O'Brian? Wha — why are you on this channel?
O'Brian: We tried — contacting you on our channel —
Deacon: Well, I lost the radio the night that shit went down.
O'Brian: Did she make it out? Your wife?
Deacon: Yeah, no thanks to you.
O'Brian: I'm glad. There's — something that I have to tell you.
Deacon: So talk.
O'Brian: In person.
Deacon: Nah, I don't think so.
O'Brian: It's important.
Deacon: Shit.
O'Brian: In the Northern Cascades, there's an old pioneer cemetery —
Deacon: Yeah¹ okay — I know the one.
O'Brian: Meet me there. Please.

[Deek goes out to the cemetery, as requested. A helo is parked in the lot
 where Alvarez died early in the game.]

Deacon: Well, I can't say I expected to hear from you again. What is it this
        time?

O'Brian: Believe it or not, I'm glad to see you again. That night at Wizard
         Island didn't seem to go well.

Deacon: What can I do for you, O'Brian?

O'Brian: I'm here to warn you.

Deacon: Warn me? Warn me about what?

O'Brian: You remember, I told you the freaks are evolving.¹

Deacon: Right, yeah, a Freak's a Freak. What the hell do I care?

[O'Brian takes off his helmet, revealing a bald, eerily pale head, almost like
 an silent film nosferatu. His voice modulation doesn't work properly.]

O'Brian: The strain of the virus, its effects on the human nervous and
         lymphatic systems — is accelerating at an exponential rate. They knew
         all along, of course. That it was happening — The men above me? That's
         why they were so cautious. So secretive. They're coming. I'm sorry.
         There's nothing you can do to stop them. There's nothing anyone can
         do.

[As the helicoper starts taking off, O'Brian jumps vertically and quickly
 catches on, then pulls himself in at inhuman speed.]

Deacon: What the fuck?

[The helo disappears in the distance. After, Copeland has a timely message.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. You heard
          me talking about the black choppers, NERO choppers. Well, none have
          been sighted in days. But don't cool your heels just yet. NERO isn't
          done, not by a long shot. With NERO out of the skies, that can only
          mean one thing: they got what they're after and they've all flown
          back to their coops. This is the end game, friends. The Feds have
          had this plan ready long before the Freaks. Now they're gonna roll
          over the earth, and woe to anyone who stands in their way. But we've
          hung on this long; we're not gonna give up now. We're fighters. We've
          survived two years in the shit. In the Freakshow. And we are nothing
          if not prepared.

Deacon: Like I said before — Cope — you don't know the half of it. But yeah,
        yeah, I'm with ya on this one — it ain't over yet.

[After "I Don't Wanna Hang," Deek visits Kouri at Diamond Lake.]

Kouri: Deacon. Good. I've got an important mission for you.
Deacon: That's why I'm here — sir.

Kouri: A group of Marauders has been attacking supply lines on our southern
       border. I've marked their position on your map. We think they're using
       a network of caves, south of Crater Lake, as their base of operations.

Deacon: Caves — okay.
Kouri: I don't have enough resources available for a full-on assault —
Deacon: So you want me to go in — quiet — and take 'em out.
Kouri: I'll leave the details up to you, Corporal. Dismissed.

[He goes out to the camp.]

Deacon: Captain — I found the Marauders who've been harassing our supply lines.
        Just where you said they'd be.

Kouri: Corporal St. John — good. Do you need assistance?

Deacon: Ah, they look pretty ragtag — I think I got this.

Kouri: Good luck, Corporal. Kouri out.

[Deek infiltrates the ridge base.]

Deacon: So you boys thought you'd just set up camp — pick off Militia supply
        runs, is that it? Ya gotta know life's not that easy.

[Soon, the seven marauders are slain.]

Deacon: Is that all of 'em? Okay, yeah. They're done. Corporal St. John to
        Diamond Lake. Come in.

Kouri: Corporal.

Deacon: Captain. Those Marauders on our southern border — have been — uh —
        neutralized.

Kouri: You said "our."
Deacon: Sir?

Kouri: You were a Drifter for a long time, St. John. Sometimes it takes a
       while for — a new recruit to accept their position as part of a greater
       force. Frankly, I didn't know if you could do it.

Deacon: Uh, well, hey — I'm in the army now —
Kouri: Yes — yes¹ you are. Dismissed¹ Corporal.

Kouri: Corporal St. John. I've got an urgent assignment for you.

Deacon: Sorta assumed that's why you radioed me to report in — sir.

Kouri: One of our patrols has been wiped out. I sent another patrol to find
       them and all of our men have been accounted for but one.

Deacon: Private Gomez? Yeah — is she alive?

Kouri: I don't know. Tracks from the site lead in all directions. I need
       someone with your — unique skills to go to the site and check it out.

Deacon: Okay. I'll do what I can.

Kouri: I know I can count on you, St. John. Dismissed.

        blood — oh, God — I hope it's not all hers. Bloody bootprint — yeah,

Deacon: Hold on. Gomez. Good to see ya breathing.
Gomez: St. John. Never thought I'd be glad to see your ugly mug.

Deacon: Hey, you got any blood left in that scrawny ass a' yours? It looks like
        you were tryin' to leave it all over the campus.

Gomez: It wasn't all mine.

Deacon: Okay. Are you good to go? Because your bike's still out front,¹ looks
        like a piece of shit — but I think it's probably that way before, you
        know?

Deacon: Corporal St. John to Captain Kouri. I, uh — found her, sir. Private
        Gomez is on her way back.

Kouri: St. John. Good work.

Deacon: I'll radio in to check on her. St. John out.

[Later...]

Deacon: St. John to Kouri. Captain, just, uh — checkin' in to make sure Gomez
        made it back okay.

Kouri: Yes. Private Gomez was very grateful. She said that if it weren't for
       you, she would have been killed.

Deacon: Uh — just doing my job, Captain. St¹ John out.

Tucker: Deek, we got a problem.
Deacon: Yeah¹ Tuck, what's up?
Tucker: You remember Alkai said that Rippers were spotted — heading our way?
Deacon: Yeah, I remember. He said he didn't try to stop them.

Tucker: Well, we've seen 'em scouting the Hot Springs. A couple of men followed
        'em back to their camp, in the cliffs south of the Twin Craters.

Deacon: Goddamn Rippers. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of 'em. I got a
        score to settle.

Tucker: A score? What are you talking about?
Deacon: Uh — never mind.

[He makes for the camp.]

Deacon: Goddamn Rippers. You fuck with my friend? I am going to fucking kill
        every Goddamn one of you.

[Deacon has various lines he can say when killing the Rippers. Examples:]

 • Rest. In. Peace. You sonofabitch.
 • Burn my friend's arm, you get low motherfucker!
 • Where's Carlos, motherfucker — huh? He send you?
 • What's your name, asshole? I wanna know who I'm killing!
 • Fuck you — you wanna Rest in Peace — let me help you out —

[After slaughtering the fiends:]

Deacon: Tucker, you there? You don't gotta worry about that Ripper Camp no
        more. I took care of 'em. Every last one of 'em.

Tucker: Nice job. Sounds like you did have a score to settle. Alkai said
        there's rumors going around, that the Rippers are after the biker
        boys.

Deacon: Let's just say they fucked with the wrong guy. Deacon out.

Tucker: Deek, thanks for stopping by.
Deacon: What's going on?

Tucker: Remember Larsen, the guy who spotted that gal in Marion Forks? The one
        I told you about?

Deacon: Yeah. I remember.

Tucker: Well he went back out there. To see what else he could find. He hasn't
        come back. We think he's been taken by a group of Drifters who've been
        moving through the Belknap wilderness.

Deacon: Shit. Where was he last seen?
Tucker: A building on the east side of town. The Old Wagon Hotel.
Deacon: Yeah, I know the one.
Tucker: Thanks, Deek. I appreciate it.

[Deek goes to the neighboring town.]

Deacon: Tucker — I'm at the Old Wagon Hotel, and I'm heading in.
Tucker: Do you see Larsen? Is he there?
Deacon: I don't know, but if he is, I'm gonna find him. St. John out.

Larsen: Help — I'm in here — Goddammit —

Deacon: Heya¹ Larsen, how're you holdin' up?

Larsen: St. John. You know, thought I'd come into town, find a drink, hang out

Deacon: Soon as I cut you loose, you get the hell outta here.

Larsen: You don't gotta tell me twice. I don't know where the hell you came
        from, but Jesus¹ man.

Deacon: Go. Run.

Deacon: Tuck, you there? I found Larsen,¹ he should be on his way back to the
        Hot Springs.

Tucker: Nice job. I'll have Alkai keep a look out for him. More Rippers have
        been spotted moving north into Belknap. We need all the men we can get.

Kouri: Corporal. Deacon. Good. Thank you for reporting in so quickly.
Deacon: It sounded urgent — sir.
Kouri: It is. We have another hostage situation.

Deacon: Hostage. Damn. It seems like every Squatter within a dozen miles has it
        in for us — or for the Militia — you know — I mean.

Kouri: It does seem that way. I've marked his last known position on your map.
       He's just a kid — St. John. Private Ross — Ethan. I sent him to track
       down a group of Marauders and he musta gotten in over his head.

Deacon: Private Ross — I don't know him — but, uh — I'll get him out alive,
        Captain.

Kouri: Good luck, St. John. Dismissed.

[Deek goes out in pursuit, entering the southern region's NE sector.]

[Down the road...]

Deacon: Oh, Jesus — helluva camp they got going on here — Now just gotta —

Deacon: Now that — that was a lotta Goddamn Marauders. Jesus.

Deacon: Hey, Ethan, I presume, uh, yeah? How ya doing, buddy?
Ethan: Corporal. Man, am I glad to see you.
Deacon: Yeah? You didn't wanna join up with those assholes?
Ethan: Hell no, and I had no idea what they were gonna do to me.

Deacon: Yeah, well, it wasn't gonna be good. Uh, are you good to get outta here
        on your own?

Ethan: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, man.

[Ethan leaves. Later, on the ride back...]

Deacon: St. John to Captain Kouri, uh — it's done¹ sir, the kid is on his way
        back.

Kouri: Good work, St. John. You've been — a huge part of what makes us
       successful. The Deschutes County Militia would not be the same without
       you.

Deacon: Thank you, sir. Um — I will radio in later and make sure he made it.
        St. John out.

[Later...]

Deacon: Deacon St. John to Captain Kouri — uh — how's that kid doing?

Kouri: Good. A little dehydrated and — hungry. The cook tells me he's almost
       cleaned out the mess hall single-handed.

Deacon: Well, tell him to save some for me. St. John out.

Deacon: Shit, what direction?

Rikki: They headed west, but they didn't go far. They've set up camp just north

Deacon: Uh, hey. Me again. I know, I know. It's, uh — been a while since I've been up here. It's just, um — okay, we, uh — had a run-in — with the
        Rippers. With Carlos. See, um — turns out, "Carlos" is actually this
        two-bit hood we knew from before. Back in the day, he was a
        fully-patched member of the MC. Yeah, I know — what are the odds of
        him surviving —  Jessie Goddamn Williamson — when so many others —
        died. And, uh — I never told you what happened to Jessie, uh — well —
        you know, because you hate it when I talk about club shit, so — let's

        uh — took a welding torch to, uh — to his back. Look, I'm not proud of

[After "How Far We Have Fallen," Deek attends a perfectly sane Garret rally.]

Garret: A short while ago, I stood here before you — And grieved for the loss
        of Captain Jiminez — Our only doctor — and my very dear friend. And for
        what great purpose did Captain Jiminez perish? So that a drug addict —
        a worthless excuse of a human being — could get high. Jiminez died
        because he stood between a junkie — and a bag full of narcotics. I have
        taken steps to see that this never happens again. For their own safety,
        I have moved Lieutenants Whitaker and Weaver into the ark — Where they
        will be under protective watch — twenty-four hours a day. The call is
        going out — any person who has highly trained knowledge and skills —
        skills that cannot be replaced — Mechanics, engineers, scientists,
        medical personnel — Are to be taken from active duty and removed to the
        ark — until this war is over. From now on, no one is allowed entrance
        into the ark unless they are on special assignment — And unless they
        are personally vetted by myself. There will be no exceptions. I am
        beginning to see — I'm afraid — that our enemy has never been the
        Freaks. They know not what they do. Mankind — in all his state of
        degradation and transgression — is our true enemy. Keep a watchful eye
        on your neighbors. Evil — surrounds us. Company dismissed.

Deacon: Cope, I found your man.

[After "You Got the Wrong Guy," Deacon is summoned to the colonel's post.]

Deacon: Colonel — you asked to see me?

Garret: Corporal. Yes. Yes¹ I did. Captain Kouri says that you've been helpful
        dealing with Marauders in the area.

Deacon: Just doing my duty — sir.

Garret: A curious group of Drifters has been spotted moving down Highway 97 —
        evidently, they came over the Thielsen Pass — which I thought to be —
        impassable. Our patrol reported that they were — scarred — the letters
        R.I.P. carved into their foreheads. Have you ever heard of anything
        like this?

Deacon: No, sir. Sounds like — sounds like another cult — like, uh — the
        Anarchists?

Garret: Perhaps. Regardless, I want you to track them down and deal with them.
        We have enough to deal with,¹ I don't need another cult springing up
        in our backyard.

Deacon: No, sir. Last thing we need is another crazy cult.
Garret: I've marked their last known position on your map. Dismissed, Corporal.

[Deacon goes out to hunt the Rippers.]

Deacon: Colonel — I've spotted that, uh — cult that you asked me to check out.
        I'm gonna deal with them.

Garret: Very good, Corporal. Keep me posted. Garret out.

[Deek sneaks into the camp to begin the slaughter, taunting all the while.]

Deacon: Rippers — oh — my Goddamn favorite — What is it, things get a little
        too hot for ya in Iron Butte? How the hell did you get over the pass?
        Remember me, assholes? Maybe head south, start all over again? Nah,
        nah — that ain't gonna happen. Where's your leader? Where's Carlos?
        Oh, that's right — he's dead. I killed him, huh? You hear me? It was
        me! Oh, but Carlos — he ain't resting in peace — he's feeding the
        fucking Freaks. And you're all gonna be feeding the fucking Freaks —

[Finally, the dozen Rippers lie dead.]

Deacon: That's all of 'em — fucking Rippers. Colonel — reporting in. That, uh —
        that cult — R.I.P. — they're no longer a threat.

Garret: Corporal — yes. It's a curious thing. I finally read the complete
        report filed by Captain Thompson — it seems they followed them for
        quite some time before engaging. Evidently, they called themselves
        Rest in Peace — seemed to worship the Freaks — strive to become just
        like them.

Deacon: Well that's pretty fucked — uh — that's pretty messed up¹ sir.

Garret: We're all soldiers here, Corporal. I'm not offended by coarse language.
        But men like that — Rest in Peace — they — offend me.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

Garret: They offend me because they show what the world has come to. We —
        Corporal St. John — are all that stand between the world — and the
        abyss.

Deacon: Uh — yes¹ sir. St. John out.

[After "With Other Men's Blood," Deacon returns to Sarah's memorial stone.]

Deacon: Uh, hey. Me again. So uh, I took Boozer into the Lost Lake Camp, and
        — I know — I know, I told you I was never going back there with Iron
        Mike threatening to break my neck and all but — Didn't have a choice.
        See, Boozer — Boozer was gonna die. And¹ uh — well, he still didn't
        wanna go — hell, I didn't wanna go. But — Like I said, I didn't have
        a choice. Neither of us did. So, it didn't matter. He¹ um — He lost the
        arm anyway. And — and now he's stuck — I mean — we're stuck — Goddamn
        Skizzo — You know, I can't remember if I told you about this clown.
        But he's the kind of asshole who's glad all this shit went down. He
        says he was, uh — gang-bangin' — in Sacramento, Fresno, I don't
        remember. But he says he's not from around here. And he's — he's not.
        Claims he was dealing drugs and guns, from California to Oregon, and
        then everything went to hell — And you know what? I think he's full of
        shit. To me, he kinda looks like a frat boy, like he was on the
        lacrosse team, peddling sodas at a — mini-mart — Or — no, no, no, man,
        he would've — He would've had a cushy job at his old man's accounting
        firm, making copies, and getting everyone their morning coffee. You
        know? Making more in a day than I ever made in a week. You know, it's
        this game that Boozer and I used to play, before we rode outta Lost
        Lake for good — We used to call it, uh — "who you were." You know,
        we'd look at someone, we'd try to guess who they were before the shit
        went down, you know? You know, I met a few drug addicts, lotta ex-cons.
        Uh, no accountants. So. That makes sense, if ya think about it. First
        couple of weeks, after the shit went down — I mean, Jesus, that was a
        Freakshow. There's no way some accountant or pencil pusher lived
        through that shit. So I dunno, maybe Skizzo's tellin' the truth — I'm
        not sorry that you missed it. I'm not. Anyway, Boozer and I wanted to
        head north, and — get away from all this shit. But — that — that ain't
        happenin' anytime soon — or — or — Happenin' ever. Uh, hey — look on
        the bright side — Looks like you're¹ uh — stuck with me. Okay. I'll
        stop by later. See ya.

Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki, what's up?

Rikki: Mitchell and a couple guys were on a run northwest of here, when they
       were hit by a group of Drifters. They tracked 'em back to a camp north
       of Melakwa Lake.

Deacon: Okay, so Mitchell — and the others — they didn't take 'em out?

Rikki: They're not Drifters, Deek — and Mitchell's just a kid. I don't even
       know if he can — if he can use a gun —

Deacon: Then what the hell are they doing out in the shit?

Rikki: Thank you¹ Deek.

Rikki: Can you handle them.

Deacon: Uh — yeah, I got this. Deacon out. Alright¹ boys — what, you thought

[Deek starts slayin'.]

Deacon: Oh, come on — time to clear this camp — Oh, please tell me that's all

        gotta let Rikki know it's done — Uh — Rikki, it's done. I cleared out
        the camp fulla Drifters north of Melakwa Lake.

Rikki: Thanks¹ Deek — I'll let Iron Mike know.
Deacon: Uh — be sure to let Mitchell know it's safe to play outside again.
Rikki: He's just a kid, Deek.

Deacon: Yeah, well — if he wants to live long enough to become an adult, he
        better start learning how to use a gun.

Rikki: Yeah, you're right. I'll start working with him. Thanks¹ Deek.

Deacon: Yeah, don't be on it¹ Cope. I'm busy.

Copeland: Too busy to hear about a Ripper Camp? Here, in the Cascade
          Wilderness?

Deacon: Rippers, up here? Where?

Copeland: Thought you might be interested. I heard how you and Boozer got hit

Deacon: Where, Cope?

Copeland: Up by Separation Meadow. Flack — you know her, don't you? Saw 'em

Boozer: Rippers? This far north?

Deacon: Yeah — Boozer, what the hell's going on with these guys? Alkai said the

Boozer: What the hell? How's that possible? I mean, sure, I've killed my share
        of crazy bastards, but I never went outta my way — uh, not that I
        remember —

Deacon: I don't know¹ Cope, I seen a lot of unbelievable shit these past couple
        years, try me.

Copeland: You remember the Anarchists?

Deacon: Came through a year ago, maybe more? Killin' anyone in their path?

Deacon: Anarchists — yeah, yeah. We had a couple of run-ins with 'em, back in

Copeland: Well — they're back. Two of my people stumbled into their camp while
          out huntin' deer. Only Bender made it back,¹ she said it was
          Anarchists. Each of them had the symbol painted on their face.

Deacon: Jesus, where? Where did she see the camp?

Copeland: I'll mark it on your map. You find 'em and kill every last one of
          'em. We got enough crazy up here dealin' with Rippers — don't need
          Anarchists movin' back in.

Deacon: You got that right,¹ I'll find 'em.

[He eventually finds the Anarchists' hideaway.]

Deacon: Cope, you were right. It's¹ um — Anarchists.

Copeland: You found 'em? Good. Got another report — they hit one of our supply
          runs coming down from Tumalo. Now you go in there and kill 'em all

Deacon: Well, thank you — sir. I'm just trying to be of service.

Garret: I've got another job for you. Drifters have set up camp southeast of
        here, along Highway 97. They are using hit and run tactics — they hit
        our supply runs, then run back to their camp — like the cowards they
        are. It appears they've created a defensive position on the rooftop of
        an old gas station. I've marked it on your map. I've consulted Captain
        Kouri and he feels it would be best to send in a single soldier —
        someone who works well alone, who might be able to use the element of
        surprise.

        long was she gonna last out there anyway? I took her to the Hot

        group of Drifters down at the Black Crater, led an attack against a
        supply run. We lost three men.

Deacon: Shit. I never liked that sonofabitch anyway. I'll take care of him.
Tucker: Thanks¹ Deek. I knew I could count on you.

[Deek makes for the Black Crater recreation area.]

Deacon: Alright¹ Rick "the Prick" Marsdon, where the hell are you? You're out
        here somewhere —

[He eventually finds the camp and sneaks in.]

Deacon: Tucker, I'm here. Your man Marsdon, looks like he's got himself a
        Goddamn army.

Tucker: Ha — doesn't surprise me. He always seemed like the kinda man who'd
        attract every dirtbag out in the shit. You want me to send Alkai?

Deacon: Uh — no. I got this. Uh — what was he wearing, when your men got hit?

Tucker: Same thing he always wore — one of those black coats, down to the
        knees. Cowboy hat. Deek, bring me his hat. More holes in it, the
        better.

Deacon: Okay, so he's dressed like an asshole. Got it. St. John out.

[Some other riders enter camp.]

Deacon: Oh, shit — where'd you boys come from — Oh, there you are — Come on —
        Rick — don't try to run away —

[Deacon's cover is eventually blown.]

Marsdon: Whatcha doin' out here, St. John? Tucker send ya? They missin' some
         supplies, maybe? We got plenty to spare — Deek? Listen to me — we got
         shit to spare — whatever that old woman is payin' — I'll double it —
         Dammit¹ St. John — listen to me! You don't gotta do this —

[He kills Marsdon and takes a trophy for Tucker.]

Deacon: Hat like this, you deserve to die, Rick "the Prick" —

[Back at Salome...]

Deacon: Hey¹ Tuck, got you a new hat.
Tucker: Nice job. Did he put up much a fight?
Deacon: So, uh — do I get paid more if he did?
Tucker: No.
Deacon: Then why do you care?

Tucker: Just enjoying the thought of how much the sonofabitch suffered before
        he bled out.

Deacon: Well — Jesus, Tuck — I don't do this shit for your entertainment.

[After "Lots of Sick People," Deacon returns to Sarah's NERO-site headstone.]

Deacon: Uh, hey. Me again. Boozer says that I shouldn't come up here anymore.
        He keeps — asking me what good's it do, and — and maybe he's right. I
        don't know. He got hurt pretty bad the other day. We ran into some
        Rippers who burned the hell out of his arm, and it looks pretty bad.
        I broke into one of those — uh, what the hell do you call them — the
        — Mobile Medical Units — and I got him sterile bandages. And I — hope
        it's enough, you know? But — Boozer, you know — he says he's fine. But
        I — I don't — I don't think so. Shit looks pretty bad to me. See the
        thing is — it was on me. I risked his life — for a bike part. A Goddamn
        bike part. Not that it mattered. Sonofabitch Copeland parted it out
        anyway. Took me a year to put that bike together. You would've liked
        it. It's not as nice as the one I taught you to ride on. But it got me
        around. Do you remember that — tank, that you had painted for me? Well,
        that was the only thing left of that old hog, and now it's — gone too.
        Soon as I get it back together — my bike, I mean — and get Boozer
        patched up, we're gonna ride north. Fresh start — you know, lotta
        memories around here. Too many. Anyway — I guess I'm just sayin' that,
        uh — I might not see you again, you know?

[After "Not Like I Got a Choice," Deacon returns to Sarah's memorial stone.]

Deacon: Uh, hey. Me again. Uh — it's been crazy here, I gotta tell ya. Um —
        you remember that night in Farewell or — yeah, well — no one's
        forgettin' about that — any — the NERO guy, O'Brian — he's alive. He —
        well — he's alive. And yeah, I admit — I¹ uh — thought — for awhile —
        I — I thought that maybe — you might be too. Which — would have made
        me feel real stupid for coming up here all this time, and well, I — I
        guess I do still feel stupid since — you didn't die here. Uh — but
        I'm — I'm real sorry that I wasn't — there — when you went in for that
        surgery. And — when you got out — six hours, O'Brian said — Jesus. You
        were always a fighter, I mean — I — should have been there. When your
        camp was overrun — I should have been there for that too. So — anyway.
        Boozer's settlin' in. I think I told you that he lost the arm — Goddamn
        Rippers — that was a shit show. And we're still at the Lost Lake Camp.
        Looks like he's — looks like we're — gonna be there for a while. Well —
        here we are. He's still a pain in the ass, I mean — you know how he
        gets. So the other day, he got drunk off his ass, decided to walk home.
        Jesus, you should have seen him. I don't know what he — look, I'm just
        sayin', I'm worried about him. Okay, I gotta go. So — uh — yeah, I'll
        be back. Bye.

[After "We Couldn't Take the Risk," Deek rides out to the radio tower atop
 Applegate Peak. Deacon clears it of Marauders. As a reward, Cope's broadcast
 plays.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. It's the
          Wild West again, and some men are actin' like law and order are a
          thing of the past. But last I checked, this is still the United
          States of America! And in America, the right of property shall not
          be infringed. We have the right to claim territory, to hold it, and
          to defend it. Sure, we took this land from the Indians — no point in
          rewriting history — but we took it by force, and force is the only
          thing that will move us now. We're not gonna roll over for a bunch
          of bullies. If the Feds, or Rippers, or Marauders think they're gonna
          come rolling into my wilderness, they got another thing coming! The
          strongest survive, the strongest take, and the strongest will
          succeed. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon. Don't believe
          the lies.

Deacon: Listen to Cope. Law and order are a thing of the past,¹ what the hell
        are you talking about? But¹ yeah — you got a point about force being
        the only thing that matters now. Force — and a lotta Goddamn ammo.

[With the foes gone, Deek climbs the tower to contact Boozer at Lost Lake.]

Deacon: I hope this is high enough — Boozer, it's Deacon. Come back. Lost Lake
        Camp, is anyone there?

Boozer: Deek? Deek, is that you? I can barely hear you. You're — you're cuttin'
        out. Where the hell are you?

Deacon: Crater Lake — believe it or not. Hey — uh, I — I —

Boozer: It's good to hear from you again, brother — uh — thought maybe, uh —
        thought maybe you were headin' back.

Deacon: No — Boozer — not yet — it's, uh — it's complicated. Look, uh — I'm
        just — I'm just sorta checkin' in, to see how — you know — how
        everything's going?

Boozer: Good — good, Deek. Things are goin' good. You will never guess who the
        old man put in charge of security —

Deacon: Wait, you?

Boozer: Yeah, you got it. Guess he figured — you know, with only one arm, I can
        only cause half as much trouble.

Deacon: Okay — yeah, like I said, I just — I just wanted to check in.
Boozer: Yeah, it was good to hear from you, brother.
Deacon: Yeah — you too.

[After "You Can't Be Replaced," Deek is called into Kouri's camp.]

Kouri: Corporal St. John. I've got an important assignment for you.
Deacon: Yes¹ sir — whatever I can do to help.

Kouri: We sent a patrol north along Highway 97 to investigate a group of —
       Anarchists. Have you ever had a run-in with them before?

Deacon: Anarchists — the assholes who left those little fucking cairns all
        over the place? Yeah — yeah, I've met 'em once or twice — uh — way
        back in the day. I — I, uh — thought they were all killed off.

Kouri: Evidently not. I've marked their location on your map. I'm sending you
       in alone in case any of our men are being held —

Deacon: Yeah, I get it. I'll have a better chance of getting 'em out alive.
        Got it.

Kouri: The patrol commander — Sergeant Mitch Allen — is a personal friend of
       mine.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir. I'll — uh — I'll do what I can.
Kouri: I'm counting on you, Corporal. Dismissed.

[In the snowy Kerr Valley, Deacon searches for clues.]

Deacon: Militia tracks — Okay, Militia gear — looks like they got dragged
        off — More tracks — A cairn — yep — Goddamn Anarchists — This is it —
        Tracks lead this way — A mine — yeah, this is it — Hey¹ Captain. I've
        found 'em. Looks like they're holed up in a mine.

Kouri: Are they holding hostages? Are they alive?

Deacon: Uh — I don't know yet. But if they are, I'll get to 'em. Sir — um —
        if they have your friend, I'll find him.

Kouri: Thank you — Kouri out.

[A firefight soon ensues.]

Deacon: Anarchists — yeah — this is definitely it. Anarchist symbols — gotta
        be the place. Where they hiding ya? A mine — another Goddamn mine.
        Another Anarchist sign — You fuckin' Anarchists. Hate every Goddamn
        one of ya. Hey, why aren't ya guys just out, like, you know¹ stacking
        up little piles a' rocks — huh? So you boys just thought you'd set up
        camp and pick off Militia supply runs, is that it? A cairn — yep —
        Goddamn Anarchists. Hey — ya want some anarchy? How about this? Hey!
        Ya like chaos? Huh? Ya like shit being all fucked up?

[Deek heads further into the mine.]

Deacon: Alright¹ Allen — Allen, you gotta be in here somewhere — Another
        Anarchist sign — Where are they hiding ya? Goddamn big mine —

[He eventually comes upon a hostage being beaten severely.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em. Good riddance. There he is — Heya¹ Sarge —
        you must be Mitch Allen?

Mitch: I was a goner — thank you — thank you, man — I thought it was over —
Deacon: I'll bet — are you — uh — good to get outta here on your own?

Mitch: Okay, alright — thanks, man, I owe you my life — I'm headin' back — I'll
       tell 'em what you did, I swear to ya —

Deacon: Just doing my job.

[Mitch leaves and Deacon soon follows. Freaks stream in following him.]

Deacon: Uh — hey — where'd you go? Or — oh — okay. Have I been down this
        tunnel? That's gotta be the way out — There — I see daylight —

[He finally makes it out, leaving the Anarchists to fight a gigantic horde.]

Deacon: Captain, I, uh, found your man. He should be on his way back to
        Diamond Lake.

Kouri: Good work, St. John.
Deacon: I'll radio back, check on him later. St. John out.

[Later...]

Deacon: Hey, Captain. Did¹ uh — Sarge make it back okay?

Kouri: He's in the infirmary now. I think he'll make a full recovery. Thanks
       to you.

Deacon: Well, just doing my job — sir.

Deacon: Corporal St. John to Lieutenant Weaver. Come back. St. John to HQ —
Weaver: This is Weaver. What can I do for you, Corporal?

Deacon: Uh, your requisition form says you need mercury? Any idea where I can
        get it?

Weaver: Yeah, sure. I should have written that shit down for you. It comes
        from, uh — cinnabar. Kouri's unit scouted out a mine north of Diamond
        Lake. Head there. Radio me when you arrive.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

Weaver: Hey, between you and me? If the Colonel isn't around, stop with all
        the "yes sir, no sir" bullshit — alright? Makes me feel old.

[Deacon rides up toward the aforementioned mine.]

Taylor: Deacon St. John! Hey — uh — I mean, you know, nothin' — just — just —

        in" thing — that was some shit, am I right?

        ya doin', huh? I'm — I'm — in the damn infantry or some shit. Spend
        all day burnin' out nests, choppin' down trees — haulin' wood. So,
        sorry — sorry, what're you doing?

        the officers working on — what —

Taylor: Oh shit! Oh, I heard about that. Yeah, yeah — workin' on — uh — on,
        uh — bioweapons, uh — chemical weapons, shit like that. Burn them
        Freaks to the ground! Am I right?

Deacon: Yeah. Look, Taylor — I gotta go.

Taylor: Alright, alright. Hey, hey, um — hey — look, man — it's, uh — it's
        just — I'm — I'm — I'm havin' second thoughts about all this — military

Taylor: Oh, shit —
Deacon: Huh — that's what I thought. Gotta go. St. John out.

Taylor: Corporal Deacon St. John — hey, you got your ears on, man? Hey —
Deacon: Taylor? Whaddya need?

Taylor: There you are — okay — uh — so I finally figured out how to use this
        damn thing. Alright, I got a secure channel and everything. So how's
        it going, man?

Deacon: Taylor, I'm kinda busy right now — so —

Taylor: Yeah — yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry¹ man, sorry. Uh — hey, so — word's out
        in the camp that drugs are makin' their way in, right under the
        Colonel's nose. It's good stuff too. But — do you know anything about
        that?

Deacon: I don't do drugs, Taylor, so no, I don't know anything about it. Why?

Taylor: No, no, no, no, no — no, no, I don't — I don't either. I'm just — I
        saw this guy, you know, one of the new recruits, actin' all suspicious
        — he rides in and out of camp all the time. And so I thought — I
        thought I'd follow him, right? See what the hell he's about.

Deacon: Goddammit, Taylor — listen to me. You just go to Kouri, let him handle
        it. You got that?

Taylor: Yeah, yeah — yeah, yeah. That's a — good call. Yeah. Okay, Mr. — St.
        John. I'll, uh — I'll talk to you later, man. Uh — out.

Deacon: Oh, Jesus Christ, Taylor. What the hell are you doing?

[Deacon finally arrives in front of the mine and its abandoned buildings.]

Deacon: Lieutenant Weaver. You there? I'm at the mine.

Weaver: Good, good. Okay¹ man — you take a look around. The report I saw listed
        ore testing kits,¹ you're gonna need one.

Deacon: An ore testing kit. Copy that.

Weaver: Uh — cinnabar is kinda red, but not shiny — it'll have a dull luster
        to it. Gonna be hard to miss. Test the ore — it's gotta be at least
        60% pure or I can't use it.

Deacon: Alright, got it. Testing kit, testing kit — where the hell am I gonna
        find an ore testing kit? Maybe — one of these, uh — shacks? Nothin' in
        here.

[He checks another.]

Deacon: Fuel can. Huh. I need — a testing kit,¹ I don't need fuel.

[With some difficulty, Deacon enters the third shack.]

Deacon: Here we go. Ore testing kit. Yeah.

[He drops down to the vehicle-blocked entrance, clears the path, and enters.]

Deacon: Okay, okay — what did he say? Red rock, dull luster. Cinnabar. Yeah.
        And now I just gotta test it. Come on — yeah. You'll do.

[Deacon goes down a one-way shaft to find two more deposits.]

Deacon: Here we go. Cinnabar. And now I just gotta test it. Alright — Gotta
        find more ore. Mining pump. They musta had problems with flooding,
        even back in the day. I just gotta get it — uh — well — turned on.

[He kills some Freaks hiding by old machinery.]

Deacon: That's the last of 'em. Let's see if this pump is workin'. Genny's out
        of gas — genny's always out of gas — Here we go. Done.

[The roar of the generator is complemented by screaming Freaks nearby.]

Deacon: Oh shit. Okay — that's not good. And we got green lights. Green lights
        are good.

[He kills the attackers.]

Deacon: More Cinnabar. That's good. Good. Okay, good. Okay — let's test you
        out — Yeah — almost enough.

[He can hear water being sucked through the pipes.]

Deacon: Yeah — that's it. Water's goin' down. Gotta finish collecting this ore,
        and then I gotta get the hell outta here.

[Deek kills the Freaks hiding near the other cinnabar samples.]

Deacon: Here's some more. Okay — let's test you out — Come on — yeah. You'll
        do. One or two more samples is all I need. Cinnabar? Yeah — Testing —
        Alright — Just one more. Here's some more. Yes, you'll work. Come on,
        ore — let's see how pure you are —

[He realizes he's just short of his quota.]

Deacon: Okay, need more ore. Elevator shaft — oh, Goddammit — wonder where
        this goes. Only one way to find out.

[The lift goes up to a bloody detritus-filled tunnel system.]

Deacon: Huh — what's up here? Another tunnel. Looks like this one was abandoned
        a long time ago. Huh — haven't been up here before —

[In one area is a blinking red light.]

Deacon: A NERO beacon — in here?

[Deek exits into fresh air.]

Deacon: Lieutenant Weaver, this is St. John. I've got the cinnabar you asked
        for.

Weaver: St. John — good, good. I'm almost ready for it. Um — oh! Hold on a
        second. Can I help you¹ Lieutenant?

Sarah: Weaver, I ran out of isopropyl alcohol. Do you have any?
Weaver: Yeah, I got a bottle of vodka back in my tent — stop by later.
Sarah: Jesus, you never give up, do you?
Weaver: Don't be such a stranger!
Sarah: Fuck off!

[Sarah leaves.]

Weaver: St. John — yeah, sorry about that. Anyway, yeah, just drop off the ore
        as soon as you can. I got some more shit I need you to get. Weaver out.

[Back at Wizard Island, Deacon enters Weaver's tent and salutes.]

Deacon: Lieutenant — 

Weaver: Nah, man. Leave that shit by the door. No, no, no — no. I mean all that
        army shit.

Deacon: Oh — Okay. Uh —

[He puts the cinnabar on the table.]

Deacon: Think that's what you were looking for.
Weaver: Alright. Yeah — yeah, this is great. Hey, just wait a second — Here.

[He hands him another requisition form.]

Deacon: Polystyrene.

Weaver: Yeah, you know, like white, foam coffee cups — Packing peanuts, shit
        like that.

Deacon: Yeah, got it.
Weaver: Hey¹ man — by the way, how did it go? With the Wizard Island Witch?
Deacon: You mean Lieutenant Whitaker?
Weaver: Man, I thought you were gonna leave all that shit by the door?

[Deacon salutes.]

Weaver: That'll be all, Corporal. That'll be all.

        him I was just tryin' to save the camp — that's all I ever wanted!

Deacon: Oh, I'ma talk to Iron Mike — as soon as they find your ass guilty, I'm
        asking him to give you to me — come midnight, me and Boozer, we're
        gonna tie you up — we're gonna put you in the middle of the highway,
        and we're gonna wait for a Horde.

Skizzo: Deek, you gotta listen to me¹ brother —
Deacon: What do you suppose that feels like, huh? Torn apart, eaten alive?

Skizzo: Deek — I was just tryin' to stop Carlos — stop the Rippers — and keep
        this camp safe — this is our life, Deek!

Deacon: You know what? I think we're gonna do that whether they find you guilty
        or not. Goodbye¹ Skizzo —

Skizzo: Deek! Deek! Dammit! Listen to me, Deek! I'm sorry, brother. I'm sorry!
        I didn't want to do it but I had to — and I didn't mean for it to go
        down this way. Deek! Listen to me! Deek!

[After "I've Got a Plan," Deacon returns to the radio tower to chat up Boozer.]

Deacon: Boozer, you there? Lost Lake Camp, come in.
Boozer: Deek! Ha — it's good to hear from you, brother. How's it goin'?
Deacon: It's¹ uh — everything's fine, Boozeman. It's, uh — I'm okay.

Boozer: Yeah? Bullshit. How long did we ride together? What's goin' on,
        brother?

Deacon: I — look, Sarah — it's a long story, but she's — she's part of the
        Militia down here. She wants to come back with me, but now, they, uh —
        they're forcing her to stay, Boozeman. They're not gonna let us leave.

Boozer: Wait, what the hell? Forcing you to stay? Jesus, Deek — where are you?
        Okay — I'm gonna grab Iron Mike, uh — uh — Rikki, some men — look,
        we'll find a way down there, we'll — we'll —

Deacon: Boozer, no — no¹ you don't understand — they've got hundreds of men,
        and they are armed — shit they stole from the National Guard, the
        military and the —

Boozer: Hey — I don't give a shit what they've got — we're gonna —

Deacon: Oh Goddammit, listen to me. You — we — cannot let the Colonel, their
        leader, find out about Lost Lake — he's crazy, Boozer, batshit-fucking¹
        crazy — the Militia, they're attacking every camp that they come across
        — Drifters, Squatters, campers — makes no difference to them.

Boozer: Ah, Jesus, Deek —

Deacon: Look, I got this — I got this figured out. Just — if anything happens
        to me — if you don't hear from me again — then —

Boozer: Deek, I'm — look, you're gonna figure this out, like you said. Okay?
        You —  you get Sarah, and you get her the hell outta there, you hear
        me?

Deacon: Yeah, Boozeman. I hear you.

Boozer: Alright — that's more like it. Uh — uh — you're cuttin' out — I — I
        can't — Deek — Deek?

Deacon: I hear you¹ brother. I hear you. Deacon out.

[After "This One's on Me," Deek attents another of Garret's sermons.]

Garret: This day, as the sun sets on this island — It also sets on the life of
        a great man — Captain Arturo Jiminez — "Doc" to many of you — is gone.
        Taken from us on the eve — of our great victory. Captain Jiminez was
        murdered — slaughtered — his life ripped from him — His blood, even
        now — soaks the tent where he toiled — Hour after hour, tending our
        sick, our injured, our wounded. The great tragedy here is not that a
        good man needlessly lost his life — though for that I am indeed, very
        sorry. The great tragedy here is that he could not be replaced. Doctor
        Jiminez was the only trained physician in our ranks — perhaps — in all
        the world. My eyes have been opened. I see now the great mistake we
        have made. We have filled our ark with books and seeds and discs.
        Medical journals, medical books, and encyclopedia¹ — we have in spades.
        But who now — when this terrible war is over — will teach us how to use
        them? Journals can be replaced. Books and encyclopedia¹ can be
        replaced. Doctor Jiminez — our only doctor — cannot be replaced. I go
        now to grieve in private. I suggest you all do the same. Company
        dismissed.

[After "We Will Take Back This World," Deacon is assigned to hostage rescue.
 He goes out to the mountainous site.]

Deacon: Colonel, Corporal St. John reporting in, and I'm at the last location
        where Lieutenant Norwood was seen — uh, it seems pretty fortified, sir.
        Are you — are you sure you want me to tackle this alone?

Garret: Just — follow orders, Corporal. Garret out.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir. Fuckin' a¹ —

[He descends to the railroad tracks. An errant bike is nearby.]

Deacon: Okay, Militia bike — that's gotta be hers. Okay — come on, you assholes
        — let's do this —

[Deek starts gunning down the kidnappers in record time.]

Deacon: Lieutenant, you in here?
Justine: In here! I'm in here!
Deacon: Okay — hang on — I'm comin' —

[He finds the woman tied to a railroad stake in the ground.]

Deacon: Okay, hang on, I'm comin'. How the hell you doin', Lieutenant?
Justine: St. John. Thank God, I'd given up hope.

Deacon: Oh yeah? Well, a good friend a' mine once told me — never give up hope.
        Because you lose that, you may as well just pack it in.

Justine: Keep that in mind next time I'm ambushed by a dozen Squatters.

Deacon: You okay? Alright, listen. Camp's clear and your bike is still in one
        piece¹ so can you just get back alone, huh?

Justine: Yeah, I can handle it. Thank you, St. John.
Deacon: Sure, now get goin', go!

[Justine leaves and Deacon starts driving back to camp.]

Deacon: Colonel, sir. Reporting in. It's, uh — well, Jesus — it wasn't easy.
        But I got her out. Lieutenant Norwood is out.

Garret: Good work, Corporal. I'll send a patrol out now.

Deacon: She said she could make it on her own. So, uh — I'll radio in later,
        make sure she made it. St. John out.

[Later...]

Deacon: Colonel, sir. Just checkin' in on Lieutenant Norwood.

Garret: Corporal. I've just read her report. She claims that you — took out an
        entire Drifter camp — single-handedly?

Deacon: Well — uh — I wasn't about to leave her in there alone — sir.

Garret: Very good, Corporal. Captain Kouri has put your name in for a
        promotion. I'm beginning to see why.

[Around the time of "What Did You Do?", Deacon gets asked to visit Salome Hot
 Springs again for a job.]

Tucker: Deek, you ever ride with a Drifter, scars all over his face, carries a
        tire iron, goes by the name of Limbo.

Deacon: Don't know him.

Tucker: He came into camp yesterday, to turn in some bounties, have a few
        drinks — seems like he didn't leave until early this morning.

Deacon: Well Tuck, I don't run security here, so why don't you just tell Alkai
        about that —

Tucker: He beat a man, Deek, and a woman, to death. Bowman and Hewitt. Her face
        was so smashed in, you couldn't tell it was her.

Deacon: Hewitt — Maria, right? Jesus. This asshole — Limbo — he's a local?

Tucker: Alkai says they've set up shop at the old Forest Service watch tower,
        on the east slope of Three Fingered Jack.

Deacon: Yeah, I know where it is, and uh — I'l handle it.

Tucker: I thought you might.

[Deacon rides out to the mountain and finds a medium-sized enemy encampment.]

Deacon: Hey Tuck, I'm here. And yeah, looks like Limbo and his crew are calling
        the place home, like nothin' ever happened. You said his face was
        scarred, so uh — I mean — more please. What else can you tell me?

Tucker: He wears a green coat. Looks like a Goddamn leprechaun. You bring me
        his tire iron, Deacon St. John — and I want it covered in what's left
        of the sonofabitch's face.

Deacon: I hear ya. Uh — St. John out.

[As Deacon infiltrates silently, he can hear the murderer's ongoing monologue.]

Limbo: See old "iron tooth" here? You wanna get all nice and cozy with him?
       Like — me puttin' him right up alongside your Goddamn face? That old
       bitch is gonna be sendin' some men out here and me an' "iron tooth"¹
       wanna be ready — You don't need no dentist with ol' "iron tooth" around,
       do ya? He'll just pop up and there and knock 'em all out at once, now
       won't he? Oh — "iron tooth" — he's gettin' kinda thirsty — oh? — Oh,
       what's that "iron tooth," you thirsty? You wanna drink somethin' warm,
       somethin' — red and thick and — gooey? Well, maybe I can help you with
       that — Come on, you sorry sonsofbitches — I want this camp locked down
       or you gonna answer to Limbo and his pal "iron tooth" —

Deacon: Huh — there you are — Okay — alright Limbo — where you at — Yeah —
        thought you'd stop by the Hot Springs — have a little fun, is that it?

[If alerted, Limbo flees upstairs.]

Deacon: He's gotta be up on that tower — Where the fuck are you?

[After looting the main enemy:]

Deacon: Still got old "iron tooth" on you, yeah?

[He returns to Salome afterwards.]

Tucker: You find that sonofabitch?
Deacon: Yeah. Here's old "iron tooth". Just like ya asked.

Tucker: Nice work. Deek? You were always the one person I could count on to
        get things done. You know, I have no idea where you and Boozer rode
        off to, but it's good to see you.

Deacon: Well, we're around, Tuck. And if you need anything, you know how to
        reach me.

Tucker: Go see Alkai,¹ I'll update your credits.

[Later, a new RFO broadcast plays.]

Copeland: This is Radio Free Oregon. The Truth Shall Set You Free. Back during
          the American Revolution, when we were fightin' for our freedoms, we
          gained the beautiful right to keep and bear arms. A right we used to
          protect ourselves, our families, our property. That is, until the
          evergrowin' Federal Government got scared of the people they swore
          to protect. Over the years, they stripped us of ever gun right they
          could, using a few mass shootings as an excuse to curtail the
          God-given rights of us, American Citizens. "Gun Control." And there
          went the Second Amedment, ladies and gentlemen. Let me ask you this:
          When all this shit went down, if every American was packin' heat, do
          you think we'd be in this mess? Hell. No. But this is how the Feds
          wanted it. Disarming the public was just the first step toward
          gettin' rid of us all. So who did those "gun laws" really protect?
          Sure as hell wasn't us, the American taxpayers. Someday, we ever dig
          outta this, I want to take a poll. I bet those who survived, were
          those who had guns. This is Mark Copeland for Radio Free Oregon.
          Don't believe the lies.

[After "I'm Good With That," Deek visits Rikki in town.]

Rikki: Deek — we really need your help.
Deacon: Rikki — hey, what's wrong?
Rikki: I just got a radio call from Jeremy —
Deacon: Jeremy?

Rikki: Givens — he's that kid who rode in a few days ago — remember the group
       he was with that got wiped out near Tumalo — I assigned him marsh duty,
       but evidently Jeremy isn't much for taking orders.

Deacon: Okay — yeah — but a radio call? Why is he out in the shit?

Rikki: He wanted to prove himself — go on a supply run by himself. Anyway, he
       ran out of gas near a farm northwest of here. I made a note on your map.
       Can you find him before —

Deacon: Yeah, before he gets himself killed? Sure, I'll have a look around.

[Deacon rides out.]

Deacon: Hey, Rikki, this, uh — farm. Where is it exactly?

Rikki: It's right across from the bridge that leads to the farm. It — it'll be
       on the left.

Deacon: Okay, you — hold on — you mean the — the Lost Lake Farm. Got it, got
        it. Deacon out.

[He reaches the farm.]

Deacon: Okay, this has gotta be it. Yeah — outta gas — so — workbench — grabbed
        a gas can — Where you going¹ Jeremy — ah, shit — Hey, Rikki — I found
        his bike —

Rikki: He's not there?

Deacon: No — uh — looks like he's headed into Sherman's Camp.

Rikki: Jesus, Deek —

Deacon: Look, he's probably at the gas station trying to pry candy bars out of
        a vending machine. Look — I'll find him.

[Deek rides into the nearby town.]

Deacon: And there's the gas station — Where are ya, kid? Okay, so you filled
        up your can — Ah¹ shit — Marauders — Come on, assholes — is that all
        of ya?

[He starts slaying the gunmen and eventually finds the kid.]

Jeremy: Mister, hey! I'm in here! I'm in here!
Deacon: Alright¹ kid, hang on — I'm comin' —
Jeremy: Mr. St. John? Oh thank God. Thank God.
Deacon: It's just Deek, kid.

Jeremy: They, uh, they — they — they were talkin' about — they were gonna cut
        me up. They were gonna eat me!

Deacon: Oh, Jesus. Okay, uh, you got this? Can you get your gas, then, get your
        ass back to camp, you got it?

Jeremy: Yes¹ sir. Yes¹ sir.
Deacon: Goddammit, don't call me sir, it's Deacon.
Jeremy: Yes¹ sir, yeah. Thank you¹ sir.

[The kid escapes.]

Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki, I got him. He's on his way back.
Rikki: Deek — what happened?

Deacon: Well — he ran into some Drifters who were — oh, Jesus — let's just say
        that he was on tonight's menu —

Rikki: Oh my God — cannibals?
Deacon: Well — I honestly didn't stop to ask them. Deacon out.

[Later...]

Iron Mike: St. John — heard you ran into some cannibals today.
Deacon: Hey, Mike. Uh — yeah — they were about to cut up Jeremy Givens —

Iron Mike: God Almighty — what drives a man to give up everything that makes
           him different from a Goddamn animal?

Deacon: Well — you know what they say — there's only nine meals between us and
        all hell breaking loose. And I'd say we're well past those nine meals.

Iron Mike: Yeah — maybe so. Hey, thanks for savin' the kid, Deek. I'll make
           sure we put him to work, maybe hold off that hellfire for another
           day or two.

Deacon: Yeah. Sure, Mike. Whatever you say. St. John out.

[After Mike's call, Deek checks up on the kid.]

Deacon: Hey, did the¹ uh — kid make it back okay?
Rikki: Hey¹ Deek, yeah. He's a little shaken, but he'll live.
Deacon: Good, good.

Rikki: Iron Mike said he even volunteered for marsh duty, if you can believe
       it.

Deacon: Oh, I believe it. Uh — hey, let me ask you somethin', does he call you
        "ma'am?"

Rikki: Yeah — how'd you know?

Rikki: Deek — thank God.
Deacon: Rikki — what's wrong?
Rikki: Do you know a man named Joshua Harper?

Deacon: Harp? Uh, yeah — yeah, I know him. I never trusted the sonofabitch.
        He, uh — wrapped a black bandana around his head like he was — some
        Goddamn hipster or something.

Rikki: Yeah, well your instincts are pretty spot-on. He shot Dan Lane in the
       back over a card game and took off!

Deacon: Oh, Jesus. Where's he now?

Rikki: A patrol spotted him heading south. They were too scared to even
       approach him. I guess he'd met up with a group of Drifters. I really
       need your help on this one —

Deacon: Okay, uh — I'll handle it.
Rikki: I marked where they spotted him on your map. Thanks¹ Deek.

[Deek goes out to the last-known location.]

Deacon: Rikki, looks like Harp and his men are headed to Camp Creek.
Rikki: You sure you can handle this?
Deacon: What do you think?
Rikki: Well — just asking. Lost Lake out.

[Deacon nears the Drifters. They're having a shootout with Freakers, which
 only attracts more to thin the ranks.]

Deacon: Gunshots — what the hell? Okay, come on, Harp — let's just do this the
        easy way, huh? Oh shit — well, go on¹ fellas, you wanna do my work for
        me? Don't let me stop you.

Rikki: Deek — did you find him?
Deacon: Uh — yeah —
Rikki: I hear gunshots —

Deacon: No — well — yeah, there's a — uh — Swarm — that kinda got to him before
        I did.

Rikki: Jesus — well, bring back his head scarf — Dan's people want proof that
       Harper is dead.

Deacon: Yeah — okay, well it — it might be a little bit — messy. Fine. Alright.
        Sure. Yes —

[If Harp is killed by enemies:]

Deacon: Huh — there he goes — Dinnertime, boys —

[Deacon collects the bandana later.]

Deacon: Okay, got it. Oh, Jesus¹ what a mess.

[Scarf in hand, Deacon rides back for camp.]

Deacon: Hey¹ Rikki. Uh — here's Harp's bandana.
Rikki: What a mess.
Deacon: Yep, that's what I said.
Rikki: Thanks¹ Deek. I'll let Dan's people know.

[Later on...]

Iron Mike: Deacon St. John — this is Lost Lake, come in.
Deacon: Yeah, Mike. This is Deek.

Iron Mike: I heard you tracked down Harp. I was hopin' you'd bring him in, for
           trial.

Deacon: Well — sorry — Mike. He¹ uh — let — let's say the Swarmers had other
        ideas about that.

Iron Mike: Ah, shit — Rikki didn't tell me that. Harp wasn't the kinda man you
           ever turned your back to, but he didn't deserve to go out like that.

Deacon: Uh — I guess not. Uh — but then I guess Dan Lane didn't deserve to get
        shot in the back either.

Iron Mike: Point well taken. See ya¹ Deek. Iron Mike out.

        Wheeler — there's that sonofabitch —

[If Deek reveals his presence somehow:]

Wheeler: Goddammit — Who is that? That you, St. John? That old bitch got you
         doin' her dirty work now? That it? You bein' the old hag's little
         errand boy? We rode together, brother! Deek — you sonofabitch — I
         tried, man — I tried — Deek — come on¹ man — it's me, Deek! Come on,
         man — don't gotta be like this. Uh — join up with us! Fuck Alkai and
         his bullshit, am I right? I know you don't like that sonofabitch —

[He kills Wheeler for his timepiece.]

Deacon: Pocket watch — here it is.

[Back at Salome...]

Deacon: Tucker, I got him.
Tucker: Nice job. I guess Wheeler's sorry he messed with Ada Tucker now.
Deacon: No — I'm guessin' he's not feeling a whole lot of anything.

Tucker: I've updated your credits. And you wait and see — I'm still gonna find
        a way to talk you and Boozer into joining us here — become a part of
        the family.

Deacon: Yeah — good luck with that.

[After "Not Like I Got a Choice," Deacon returns to Salome at Tuck's behest.]

Tucker: Deacon, thank God.
Deacon: What's wrong, Tuck?
Tucker: It's Rippers. More Goddamned Rippers.
Deacon: Oh good, Rippers. Okay, where?

Tucker: They keep coming over the Iron Butte pass. Now they've set up a camp
        along Bear Creek, just south of here. I'm afraid, Deek. If we don't
        stop them, what's going to happen to the Hot Springs?

Deacon: I get it, I get it — don't worry about this, Tuck. I got this.

[Deek arrives at the streamside bivouac.]

Deacon: Hey¹ Tuck, I'm at that Ripper Camp and it doesn't look like there's
        too many of 'em, so — you know — must be a scouting party.

Tucker: Kill 'em — kill 'em all, Deek.

Deacon: Yeah, Tuck. You don't gotta tell me. St. John out. Goddamn Rippers. My
        friend — lost an arm because of you bastards — You wanna Rest in Peace?
        I can help you out with that — Come on you sonsofbitches — come on.
        You wanna get low, huh?

[All six lay dead soon enough.]

Deacon: Goddamn Rippers — rest — in hell — the lot of ya. Well, I better get
        back, so — okay — uh — okay, I gotta just turn this in to Tucker —
        Tucker, it's done.

Tucker: Did you get them all?

Deacon: Uh — yeah¹ Tuck, I got 'em all. Isn't that what you're paying me for?

Tucker: Sorry. It's just — this is the third time they've come up here —
        attacking our camp, taking and killing that poor girl, Lisa — we have
        to stop 'em¹ Deek, we have to.

Deacon: Uh — Tuck — sonofabitch — uh — listen — I've been to Iron Butte — and,
        uh — I've seen part of what they're building —

Tucker: What? When — how did you —

Deacon: No — it doesn't matter. But trust me on this — there's too many of 'em
        — hundreds, maybe — maybe thousands — and if they decide to come north,
        you ain't gonna stop 'em. You just ain't. Alright? So just keep doin'
        what you're doin' — you kill any that cross the border, and that's
        gonna let Carlos know that he ain't moving north without a fight. It's
        the best you can do. St. John out.

[Shortly after "Smoke on the Mountain," Boozer radios in with a side job.]

Boozer: Deek? You there? Did — did you say you were headin' north?
Deacon: Boozeman — no. You know I wouldn't — ride north without you.
Boozer: Yeah, yeah — I know. I'm just — kinda — out of it.
Deacon: Well, third degree burns'll do that to ya.
Boozer: Yeah — so — take care of Alvarez. You know? Deek — it means a lot to

Deacon: I'll take care of her, Boozer — just, get some rest. Deacon out.

 molotov on it to keep anything from desecrating it.]

Deacon: Rest in peace. They can't get you now.

[After "This One's on Me," Deek is called back to Garret in town.]

Garret: Corporal St. John. We have a situation — that I think you can help us
        with.

Deacon: Okay — sir.

Garret: One of our soldiers has been taken hostage — Sergeant Melinda Foster —
        in charge of patrolling our eastern border, along the 97 corridor. Her
        squad was ambushed. Two men made it back — alive. Sergeant Foster was
        taken.

Deacon: Melinda Foster —
Garret: Do you know her?
Deacon: No¹ sir, I don't.

Garret: I've marked her last known location on your map. I have full confidence
        — Corporal — that you will return her safely.

Deacon: You can count on me, sir.
Garret: Dismissed, Corporal.

[Deek goes up onto the southern highway above Crater Lake's rim.]

Deacon: A Militia bike — it's gotta be hers —

[He tracks her captors to a nearby radio tower installation.]

Deacon: Colonel — Corporal St. John reporting in. Sir. I'm at that location —
        and the, uh — camp appears to be empty.

Garret: Sergeant Foster's life is in your hands, Corporal. Don't let me down.

Deacon: Nope — sir. I'll find her.

[He creeps in, only to find ambushers waiting. He lays 'em to rest soon after.]

Deacon: That's all of 'em? Looks like — just another day at the office —

[He jimmies the door to the main building, finding Foster and a captor.]

Torturer: I'll kill her — I swear —

[Deacon immediately puts him down.]

Deacon: How you doing, Sarge? How's your day going so far?
Foster: Jesus, Corporal. Thank you. It's going great. Just great.
Deacon: Do you need a lift back?
Foster: You see a Militia bike out front? Or did the bastards part it out?
Deacon: No, no. It's still there.

Foster: Okay, I'm good then. St. John, right? Thank you. I can get back on my
        own.

[Foster leaves.]

Deacon: Colonel — found Sergeant Foster. She's headin' back now.
Garret: Good work, Corporal.

Deacon: Thank you, sir. I'll, uh — I'll check back in later, see how she's
        doing. St. John out.

[Later...]

Deacon: Colonel — sir. Reporting in.
Garret: Yes?

Deacon: Corporal St. John, sir. I — I wanted to check to see how Sergeant
        Foster was doing.

Garret: Foster, yes, yes, uh — she'll be fine. Thank you, Corporal. Her report
        contained high praise for your actions and bravery. You are to be —
        commended.

Deacon: Well, thank you — sir. She's, um — she's a survivor.
Garret: We're all survivors, aren't we?
Deacon: Yes¹ sir. St. John out.

[During "I've Had Better Days," the colonel radios in.]

Garret: St. John — Corporal St. John. Come in. I need you to report to me ASAP.
Deacon: Hey¹ Colonel — uh — yes¹ sir. St. John out.

[If he reports in promptly, there's dialogue at Wizard Island.]

Deacon: Colonel, sir. Reporting in as ordered.

Garret: Corporal. Good. Good. How are things progressing with Lieutenant
        Weaver? Lieutenant Whitaker?

Deacon: Uh — good, Sir. I usually have a couple of requisition forms that I
        need to fill for them. Uh — they're — they are keeping me busy.

Garret: Good. I have another assignment — one that can use your tracking
        skills. One of our — workers — has escaped. Her name was — Adkins,
        Crystal. She's easy to identify — her face is covered with tattoos —
        prison tattoos.

Deacon: Mm-hmm. Yeah, the night I was sworn in — she was brought in with me
        and Private Taylor —

Garret: Exactly so. Apparently she didn't like her work assignment. Before
        dawn, she bribed a guard and stole a bike. Before she left, she broke
        into the ark and stole some jewellery.

Deacon: Jewellery, sir?

Garret: The rank and file are not allowed to wear jewellery of any kind,
        Corporal, as you well know. Her rings were — confiscated — when she
        arrived. I guess she wanted them back. I — want them returned.

Deacon: But she didn't enlist — she — um —

Garret: Don't question orders, soldier. She knows too much about our compound,
        our defences. She is a — problem — and we can't afford — problems. Am
        I understood, Corporal?

Deacon: Yes¹ sir.

Garret: I've marked her last known position on your map. Kouri tells me she was
        first seen at a logging camp, to the north. I'd start there — maybe she
        has — friends in the area who are helping her. Dismissed¹ Corporal.

[Deek heads northeast of Crater Lake and finds a smoldering bike nearby.]

Deacon: Colonel. I'm at the location where she was last spotted.
Garret: You found her?

Deacon: Not yet, but, uh — I see an abandoned Militia bike — so — she can't
        have gone far.

Garret: Very good, Corporal. Carry out your orders. Garret out.
Deacon: Militia bike — that's gotta be hers.

[Deek visits the logging camp and finds it occupied by brigands.]

Deacon: Oh, good, Marauders. Are these your friends, Crystal? Because they
        don't look too friendly —

[Deacon kills the dozen.]

Deacon: Oh, yeah — that's all of 'em — Uh — one of those shacks — In here —
        gotta be in here —

[He breaks in, finding Crystal battered and tied to a chair.]

Deacon: Oh, man, you keep pickin' the wrong friends.
Crystal: Screw you.
Deacon: Hey, hey. You — you don't remember me.¹

Crystal: Oh, I remember you. Standing up on that stage, kissing the Colonel's
         ass like a good little soldier.

Deacon: Well, Jesus Christ. Do you know why I'm here?

Crystal: I figure the sonofabitch Colonel put a bounty on my head. So do it
         already. I don't give a shit. What the hell are you doing?

[Deek unties her.]

Deacon: I'm not gonna kill ya. I just — I need the rings.

Crystal: Those are my Goddamn rings. The sonofabitches stole 'em from me,
         they're mine.

Deacon: Yeah, yeah they are. But it's either the rings or your life. So what's
        it gonna be?

Crystal: You can go to hell.
Deacon: You're welcome!

[He lets her run off and returns to Garret on the island.]

Deacon: Colonel, sir. Reporting in. I'm — uh — returning the stolen property.

Garret: Corporal. Yes. The worker — common thief and murderer. Did she put up
        a fight?

Deacon: Yes, sir. Yes — yes¹ she did, uh — she put up a hell of a fight. But
        it was nothing that I couldn't handle.

Garret: You fight on the side of righteousness, Corporal. Don't give it another
        thought. It is those like her — liars, thieves, murderers, drug
        addicts — criminals all — who brought this scourge down upon us. I
        will not weep to see them gone — every one. Dismissed¹ Corporal.

Deacon: Yes¹ sir. I'll — I'll get back to work.

Garret: My brothers and sisters in arms — I stand here before you — in

        assembling and training our army. Lieutenant Whitaker — has been
        working tirelessly on a biological weapon — That will allow us to kill
        hundreds of Freaks at once. Lieutenant Weaver is working on a chemical
        weapon — that will allow us to burn down entire Hordes. Soon, slash and
        burn will be a thing of the past. We will go from fighting a defensive
        war — to an offensive war — As we take the fight to the Freaks, as we
        work to retake our world. And behold, He said — the enemy who sowed
        them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the
        reapers are angels. And they will gather out of His kingdom all evil,
        and throw them into the furnace of fire — In that place, there will be

Kouri: St. John. This is Captain Kouri. Come in.
Deacon: Yeah, Captain. I'm here.

Kouri: Well I just wanted to let you know that the Colonel gives an informal —
       talk — every day at dusk. At the staging area where you were sworn in,

Deacon: Uh — yes¹ sir.

Kouri: Now, while these talks are "informal," enlisted men and women are
       expected to attend.

Deacon: Uh — copy that. Sir.
Kouri: Kouri out.
Deacon: Oh, great. A commander who likes to give fireside chats. Can't wait.

[Deek goes to the staging grounds for his first speech.]

Garret: These past few days, dozens of new recruits have joined our ranks. We
        welcome you. We do not care about the color of your skin. We do not
        care what country you were born in. We do not care if you are a man or
        a woman. We do not care if you are gay or lesbian or bisexual or
        transgender. These are things — beyond your control. These are things
        that God has ordained. And we accept them. What we do not accept are
        liars, thieves, rapists, murderers, fornicators, adulterers, oath
        breakers, drug addicts, or criminals of any kind — From this life or
        the one before. How you conduct yourself, how you act in the eyes of
        God — these are things that you do control. Any soldier, or officer,
        found guilty of any transgression — no matter how small — Will be
        brought here, to this very scaffold, and will be hanged by the neck
        until they are dead. This punishment may seem cruel to some of you.
        But you have my promise — any punishment of ours is a great mercy
        compared to the punishment of God that is being unleashed on the world
        outside these walls. None of us is perfect. We do not expect
        perfection. What we do expect — is obedience, order and discipline.
        Give us these things, and we will win this war. Company dismissed.

        place. Helped me to build this ark. But whether you were with us from

        this great endeavor. You — are now part of our mission to save mankind.
        I want to remind you, as you go forth beyond these walls to perform
        your duties, that we are still searching for material worthy — Of
        safekeeping within the ark. We seek textbooks, manuals, encyclopediae,
        discs, and other media. Lieutenant Weaver has listed several books on
        chemistry that are needed. Lieutenant Whitaker has listed books on
        biochemistry, genetics, and biology that we are lacking. Captain
        Jiminez has listed books on medicine, anatomy, and surgical procedures that we need. Sergeant Tomlinson — has listed books on highway
        construction, mechanical engineering. And Captain Hawkins is always
        looking for material related to agriculture and hydroponics. So — while
        you're out doing runs, keep an eye out for items like these. Do your
        part — to help us fill the ark. Company dismissed.
